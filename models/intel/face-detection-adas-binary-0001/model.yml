description: >-
  Face detector for driver monitoring and similar scenarios. The network features
  a pruned MobileNet backbone that includes depth-wise convolutions to reduce
  the amount of computation for the 3x3 convolution block. Also some 1x1 convolutions
  are binary that can be implemented using effective binary XNOR+POPCOUNT approach
