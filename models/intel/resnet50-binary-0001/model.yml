description: >-
  This is a classical classification network for 1000 classes trained on ImageNet.
  The difference is that most convolutional layers were replaced by binary once
  that can be implemented as XNOR+POPCOUN operations. Only input, final and shortcut
  layers were kept as FP32, all the rest convolutional layers are replaced by
  BinaryConvolution layers.
