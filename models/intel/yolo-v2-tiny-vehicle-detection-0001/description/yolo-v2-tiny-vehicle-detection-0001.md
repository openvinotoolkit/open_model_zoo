# yolo-v2-tiny-vehicle-detection-0001

## Use Case and High-Level Description

This is a YOLO v2 Tiny network finetuned for vehicle detection for the "Barrier" use case.

Tiny Yolo V2 is a real-time object detection model implemented with Keras\*
from this [repository](https://github.com/david8862/keras-YOLOv3-model-set)
and converted to TensorFlow\* framework.

This model was pretrained on COCO\* dataset with 80 classes and then finetuned for vehicle detection.


## Specification

| Metric            | Value         |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Type              | Detection     |
| mAP               | 88.64%        |
| coco\_precision   | 94.97%        |
| GFLOPs            | 5.424         |
| MParams           | 11.229        |
| Source framework  | Keras\*       |

## Input

Image, name - `image_input`, shape - `1,3,416,416`, format is `B,C,H,W` where:

- `B` - batch size
- `C` - channel
- `H` - height
- `W` - width

Channel order is `BGR`.

## Output

The array of detection summary info, name - `predict_conv/BiasAdd/YoloRegion`,
shape - `1,71825`, which could be reshaped to `1, 425, 13, 13` with format `B,N*85,Cx,Cy` where
- `B` - batch size
- `N` - number of detection boxes for cell
- `Cx`, `Cy` - cell index

Detection box has format [`x`,`y`,`h`,`w`,`box_score`,`class_no_1`, ..., `class_no_80`], where:
- (`x`,`y`) - coordinates of box center relative to the cell
- `h`,`w` - raw height and width of box, apply [exponential function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_function) and multiply with corresponding anchors to get height and width values relative to the cell
- `box_score` - confidence of detection box in [0,1] range
- `class_no_1`,...,`class_no_80` - probability distribution over the classes in the [0,1] range, multiply by confidence value to get confidence of each class

The anchor values are `0.57273,0.677385, 1.87446,2.06253, 3.33843,5.47434, 7.88282,3.52778, 9.77052,9.16828`.
