description: >-
  This is the Inception v3 model that is designed to perform image classification.
  The model has been pretrained on the ImageNet image database and then pruned
  to **30.9%** of sparsity and quantized to INT8 fixed-point precision using
  so-called Quantization-aware training approach implemented in TensorFlow framework.
  The sparsity is represented by zeros inside the weights of Convolutional and
  Fully-conneted layers. For details about the original floating point model,
  check out the paper <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf>.

  The model input is a blob that consists of a single image of "1x299x299x3"
  in BGR order.

  The model output for `inceptionv3-int8-sparse-v1-tf-0001` is the usual object
  classifier output for the 1001 different classifications matching those in
  the ImageNet database (the first item represents the background).
