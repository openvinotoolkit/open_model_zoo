description: >-
  This is a speech synthesis composite model that simultaneously reconstructs
  mel-spectrogram and wave form from text. The model generates wave form
  from symbol sequences separated by space for forty speakers.
  The speaker voice characteristics are represented by vector of two numbers.
  The model is built on top of the modified ForwardTacotron and modified MelGAN frameworks.
