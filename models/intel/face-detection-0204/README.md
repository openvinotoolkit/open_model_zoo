# face-detection-0204

## Use Case and High-Level Description

Face detector based on MobileNetV2 as a backbone with a
multiple SSD head for indoor and outdoor scenes shot by a front-facing camera.
During the training of this model, training images were resized to 448x448.

Average Precision (AP) is defined as an area under the
[precision/recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall)
curve. All numbers were evaluated by taking into account only faces bigger than
64 x 64 pixels.

## Inputs

Image, name: `input`, shape: `1, 3, 448, 448` in the format `B, C, H, W`, where:

- `B` - batch size
- `C` - number of channels
- `H` - image height
- `W` - image width

Expected color order: `BGR`.

## Outputs

The net outputs blob with shape: `1, 1, 200, 7` in the format `1, 1, N, 7`, where `N` is the number of detected
bounding boxes. Each detection has the format [`image_id`, `label`, `conf`, `x_min`, `y_min`, `x_max`, `y_max`], where:

- `image_id` - ID of the image in the batch
- `label` - predicted class ID (0 - face)
- `conf` - confidence for the predicted class
- (`x_min`, `y_min`) - coordinates of the top left bounding box corner
- (`x_max`, `y_max`) - coordinates of the bottom right bounding box corner

## Training Pipeline

The OpenVINO [Training Extensions](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/training_extensions/blob/develop/README.md) provide a [training pipeline](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/training_extensions/blob/develop/models/object_detection/model_templates/face-detection/readme.md), allowing to fine-tune the model on custom dataset.
