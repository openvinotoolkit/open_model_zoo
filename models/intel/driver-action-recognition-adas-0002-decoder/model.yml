description: >-
  This is an action recognition model for the driver monitoring use case. The
  model uses Video Transformer approach with MobileNetv2 encoder. It is able to
  recognize the following actions: drinking, doing hair or making up, operating
  the radio, reaching behind, safe driving, talking on the phone, texting.

  This model is only decoder part of the whole pipeline. It accepts stack of frame
  embeddings, computed by driver-action-recognition-adas-0002-encoder, and produces
  prediction on input video. Video frames should be sampled to cover ~1 second
  fragment (i.e. skip every second frame in 30 fps video).
