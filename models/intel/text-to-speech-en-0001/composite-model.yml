description: >-
  This is a speech synthesis composite model that simultaneously reconstructs
  mel-spectrogram and wave form from text. The model generates wave form from
  symbol sequences separated by space. The model is built on top of the modified
  ForwardTacotron and modified MelGAN frameworks.
