description: >-
  This is the Resnet-50 v1 model that is designed to perform image classification.
  The model has been pretrained on the ImageNet image database and then quantized
  to INT8 fixed-point precision using so-called Quantization-aware training approach
  implemented in TensorFlow framework. For details about the original floating
  point model, check out the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf).

  The model input is a blob that consists of a single image of "1x224x224x3"
  in BGR order.

  The model output for `resnet-50-int8-tf-0001` is the usual object classifier
  output for the 1000 different classifications matching those in the ImageNet
  database.
