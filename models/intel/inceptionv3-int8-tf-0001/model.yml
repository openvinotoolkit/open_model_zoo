description: >-
  This is the Inception v3 model that is designed to perform image classification.
  The model has been pretrained on the ImageNet image database and then quantized
  to INT8 fixed-point precision using so-called Quantization-aware training
  approach implemented in TensorFlow framework. For details about the original
  floating point model, check out the paper <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf>.

  The model input is a blob that consists of a single image of "1x299x299x3"
  in BGR order.

  The model output for `inceptionv3-int8-tf-0001` is the usual object classifier
  output for the 1001 different classifications matching those in the ImageNet
  database (the first item represents the background).
