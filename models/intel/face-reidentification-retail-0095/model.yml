  This is a lightweight network for the face re-identification scenario. It is
  based on MobileNet V2 backbone, which consists of 3x3 inverted residual blocks
  with squeeze-excitation attention modules. Instead of the ReLU6 activations
  used in the original MobileNet V2, this network uses PReLU ones. After the backbone,
  the network applies global depthwise pooling and then uses 1x1 convolution to
  create the final embedding vector. The model produces feature vectors which
  should be close in cosine distance for similar faces and far for different faces.
