description: >-
  There are 3 models for smartlab action recogntion including two encoder models and one decoder model.
  These models are fine-tuned with smartlab dataset to predict actions and can classfy 3 types of action including "noise_action", "put_take" and "adjust_rider".
task_type: action_recognition
framework: dldt
stages_order:
  - smartlab-action-recognition-0001-encoder-side
  - smartlab-action-recognition-0001-encoder-top
  - smartlab-action-recognition-0001-decoder
