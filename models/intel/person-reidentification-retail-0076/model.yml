description: >-
  This is a person reidentification model for a general scenario. It uses a whole
  body image as an input and outputs an embedding vector to match a pair of images
  by the Cosine distance. The model is based on RMNet backbone that was developed
  for fast inference. A single reidentification head from the 1/16 scale feature
  map outputs the embedding vector of 256 floats. The model is provided without
  last calibration layer, but can be used in the same way as the original model
  (with insignificant drop in accuracy).
