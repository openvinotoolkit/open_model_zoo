# icnet-camvid-ava-0001

## Use Case and High-Level Description

A trained model of ICNet for fast semantic segmentation, trained on the CamVid\* dataset from scratch using the TensorFlow\* framework. For details about the original floating-point model, check out [ICNet for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation on High-Resolution Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08545).

The model input is a blob that consists of a single image of `1x3x720x960` in the BGR order. The pixel values are integers in the [0, 255] range.

The model output for `icnet-camvid-ava-0001` is the predicted class index of each input pixel belonging to one of the 12 classes of the CamVid dataset.

## Specification

| Metric            | Value                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------|
| GFlops            | 151.82Bn              |
| MParams           | 25.45                 |
| Source framework  | TensorFlow\*          |

## Accuracy

The quality metrics were calculated on the CamVid\* validation dataset. The `unlabeled` class had been ignored during metrics calculation.

| Metric                    | Value         |
|---------------------------|---------------|
| mIoU                      |        69.54% |

- `IOU=TP/(TP+FN+FP)`, where:
  - `TP` - number of true positive pixels for given class
  - `FN` - number of false negative pixels for given class
  - `FP` - number of false positive pixels for given class


## Performance

## Input

Image, shape - `1,3,720,960`, format is `B,C,H,W` where:

- `B` - batch size
- `C` - channel
- `H` - height
- `W` - width

Channel order is `BGR`.

## Output

Semantic segmentation class prediction map, shape - `1,720,960`, output data format is `B,H,W` where:

- `B` - batch size
- `H` - horizontal coordinate of the input pixel
- `W` - vertical coordinate of the input pixel

Output contains the class prediction result of each pixel.
