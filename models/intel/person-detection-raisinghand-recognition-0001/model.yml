description: >-
  This is an action detector for the Smart Classroom scenario. It is based on
  the RMNet backbone that includes depth-wise convolutions to reduce the amount
  of computations for the 3x3 convolution block. The first SSD head from 1/16
  scale feature map has four clustered prior boxes and outputs detected persons
  (two class detector). The second SSD-based head predicts actions of the detected
  persons. Possible actions: raising hand and other.
