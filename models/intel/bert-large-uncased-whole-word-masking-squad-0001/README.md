# bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-squad-0001

## Use Case and High-Level Description

This is a BERT-large model pre-trained on lower-cased English text using Whole-Word-Masking and fine-tuned on the SQuAD v1.1 training set (93.21% F1, 87.2% EM on the v1.1 dev set). The model performs question answering for English language; the input is a concatenated premise and question for the premise, and the output is the location of the answer to the question inside the premise. For details about the original floating-point model, check out [BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805).

Tokenization occurs using the BERT tokenizer (see the demo code for implementation details) and the enclosed `vocab.txt` dictionary file. Input is to be lower-cased before tokenizing.

## Specification

| Metric            | Value                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------|
| GOps              | 246.93                |
| MParams           | 333.96                |
| Source framework  | PyTorch\*             |

## Accuracy

The quality metrics were calculated on the SQuAD v1.1 dataset (`dev` split). Maximum sequence length is 384, maximum query length: 64, doc stride: 128, input is lower-cased.

| Metric                    | Value         |
|---------------------------|---------------|
| F1                        |        93.21% |
| Exact match (EM)          |        87.20% |

## Input

1. Token IDs, name: `input_ids`, shape: `1, 384`.
Sequence of tokens (integer values) representing the tokenized premise and question (`input_ids`). The sequence structure is as follows (`[CLS]`, `[SEP]` and `[PAD]` should be replaced by corresponding token IDs as specified by the dictionary):
`[CLS]` + *tokenized question* + `[SEP]` + *tokenized premise of the question* + `[SEP]` + (`[PAD]` tokens to pad to the maximum sequence length of 384)

2. Input mask, name: `attention_mask`, shape: `1, 384`.
Sequence of integer values representing the mask of valid values in the input (`input_mask`). The values of this input are equal to:
    * `1` at positions corresponding to the `[CLS]` + *tokenized question* + `[SEP]` + *tokenized premise of the question* + `[SEP]` part of the Token IDs (i.e. all positions except those containing the `[PAD]` tokens), and
    * `0` at all other positions

3. Segment IDs, name: `token_type_ids`, shape: `1, 384`.
Sequence of integer values representing the segmentation of the Token IDs into question and premise (`segment_ids`). The values are equal to:
    * `1` at positions corresponding to the *tokenized premise of the question* + `[SEP]` part of the Token IDs, and
    * `0` at all other positions

## Output

1. Answer start, name: `output_s`, shape: `1, 384`.
Floating point-valued logit scores, where i-th value corresponds to the log-likelihood of the answer to the question starting at the i-th token position of the input.

2. Answer end, name: `output_e`, shape: `1, 384`.
Floating point-valued logit scores, where i-th value corresponds to the log-likelihoods of the answer ending at i-th token position.
