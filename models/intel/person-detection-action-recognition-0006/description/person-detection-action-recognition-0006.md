# person-detection-action-recognition-0006

## Use Case and High-Level Description

This is an action detector for the Smart Classroom scenario. It is based on the RMNet backbone that includes depth-wise convolutions to reduce the amount of computations for the 3x3 convolution block. The first SSD head from 1/8 and 1/16 scale feature maps has four clustered prior boxes and outputs detected persons (two class detector). The second SSD-based head predicts actions of the detected persons. Possible actions: sitting, writing, raising hand, standing, turned around, lie on the desk.

Average Precision (AP) is defined as an area under the [precision/recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall)
curve.

## Performance

## Inputs

Name: `input`, shape: [1x400x680x3] - An input image in the format [BxHxWxC],
   where:
    - B - batch size
    - H - image height
    - W - image width
    - C - number of channels

   Expected color order is BGR.

## Outputs

The net outputs four branches:

1. name: `ActionNet/out_detection_loc`, shape: [b, num_priors*4] - Box coordinates in SSD format
2. name: `ActionNet/out_detection_conf`, shape: [b, num_priors*2] - Detection confidences
3. name: `ActionNet/action_heads/out_head_1_anchor_1`, shape: [b, 6, 50, 86] - Action confidences
4. name: `ActionNet/action_heads/out_head_2_anchor_1`, shape: [b, 6, 25, 43] - Action confidences
5. name: `ActionNet/action_heads/out_head_2_anchor_2`, shape: [b, 6, 25, 43] - Action confidences
6. name: `ActionNet/action_heads/out_head_2_anchor_3`, shape: [b, 6, 25, 43] - Action confidences
7. name: `ActionNet/action_heads/out_head_2_anchor_4`, shape: [b, 6, 25, 43] - Action confidences

Where:
    - b - batch size
    - num_priors -  number of priors in SSD format (equal to 50x86x1+25x43x4=8600)
