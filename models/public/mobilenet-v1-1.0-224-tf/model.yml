  "mobilenet-v1-1.0-224" is one of MobileNets - small, low-latency, low-power models
  parameterized to meet the resource constraints of a variety of use cases. They can
  be built upon for classification, detection, embeddings and segmentation similar
  to how other popular large scale models are used. For details, see the paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861>.
