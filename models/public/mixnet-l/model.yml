  MixNets are a family of mobile-sizes image classification models equipped with MixConv,
  a new type of mixed depthwise convolutions. The "mixnet-l" model is one of the
  MixNet <https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.09595> models  designed. This model was pretrained in TensorFlow*.
  All the MixNet models have been pretrained on the ImageNet* image database.
  For details about this family of models, check out the TensorFlow Cloud TPU repository
  <https://github.com/tensorflow/tpu/tree/master/models/official/mnasnet/mixnet>.
