  MixNets are a family of mobile-sizes image classification models equipped with MixConv,
  a new type of mixed depthwise convolutions. There are three MixNet architectures
  - "MixNet-S" (Small), "MixNet-M" (Middle), "MixNet-L" (Large). The main differences
  are using MixConv with different kernel sizes and number of layers. Using "MixNet-L"
  allows to achieve greater accuracy. Use this link <https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.09595>
  to learn more about MixNet architectures. "MixNet-L" was pretrained in TensorFlow*.
  All the MixNet models have been pretrained on the ImageNet* image database. For
  details about this family of models, check out the TensorFlow Cloud TPU repository
  <https://github.com/tensorflow/tpu/tree/master/models/official/mnasnet/mixnet>.
