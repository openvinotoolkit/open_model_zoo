  The "efficientnet-b0_auto_aug" model is one of the EfficientNet <https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946>
  models designed to perform image classification, trained with AutoAugmentation preprocessing
  <https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09501>. This model was pre-trained in TensorFlow*. All
  the EfficientNet models have been pre-trained on the ImageNet image database. For
  details about this family of models, check out the TensorFlow Cloud TPU repository
  <https://github.com/tensorflow/tpu/tree/master/models/official/efficientnet>.
