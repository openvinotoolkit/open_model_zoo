  This model was created for participation in the Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge
  <https://www.med.upenn.edu/sbia/brats2018.html> (BraTS) 2018.   The model is
  based on the corresponding paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04008>, where authors
  present deep cascaded approach for automatic brain tumor segmentation. The paper
  describes modifications to 3D UNet architecture and specific augmentation strategy
  to efficiently handle multimodal MRI input. Besides this, the approach to enhance
  segmentation quality with context obtained from models of the same topology
  operating on downscaled data is introduced.   Each input modality has its own
  encoder which are later fused together to produce single output segmentation.
