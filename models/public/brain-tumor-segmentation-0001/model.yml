  This model was created for participation in the Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge
  <https://www.med.upenn.edu/sbia/brats2018.html> (BraTS) 2018. The model is based
  on the corresponding paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04008>, where authors present
  deep cascaded approach for automatic brain tumor segmentation. The paper describes
  modifications to 3D UNet architecture and specific augmentation strategy to efficiently
  handle multimodal MRI input. Besides this, the approach to enhance segmentation
  quality with context obtained from models of the same topology operating on downscaled
  data is introduced. Each input modality has its own encoder which are later fused
  together to produce single output segmentation.
