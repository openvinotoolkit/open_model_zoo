  The "AclNet" model is designed to perform sound classification and is trained on
  internal dataset of environmental sounds for 53 different classes, listed in file
  "<omz_dir>/data/dataset_classes/aclnet.txt". For details about the model, see this
  paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06669>.

  The model input is a segment of PCM audio samples in "N, C, 1, L" format.

  The model output for "AclNet" is the sound classifier output for the 53 different
  environmental sound classes from the internal sound database.
