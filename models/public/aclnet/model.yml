  The "AclNet" model is designed to perform sound classification. The "AclNet" model
  is trained on an internal dataset of environmental sounds. For details about the
  model, see this paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06669>.

  The model input is a segment of PCM audio samples in [N, C, H, W] format with the
  shape [1, 1, 1, 16000].

  The model output for "AclNet" is the sound classifier output for the 53 different
  environmental sound classes from the internal sound database.
