  The `octave-resnet-101-0.125` model is a modification of `resnet-101` from this
  paper <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf> with octave convolutions from Drop
  an Octave: Reducing Spatial Redundancy in Convolutional Neural Networks with
  Octave Convolution <https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05049> with `alpha=0.125`. As
  origin, it's designed to perform image classification. For details about family
  of octave convolution models, check out the repository <https://github.com/facebookresearch/OctConv>.

  The model input is a blob that consists of a single image of 1x3x224x224 in
  RGB order. The RGB mean values need to be subtracted as follows: [124,117,104]
  before passing the image blob into the network. In addition, values must be
  divided by 0.0167.

  The model output for `octave-resnet-101-0.125` is the typical object classifier
  output for the 1000 different classifications matching those in the ImageNet
  database.
