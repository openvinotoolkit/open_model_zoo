  Ultra-lightweight Face Detection RFB 320 is a version of the lightweight face detection
  model with the modified RFB(Receptive Field Block) module. The model designed for
  edge computing devices and pre-trained on the WIDER FACE <http://shuoyang1213.me/WIDERFACE/>
  dataset with 320x240 input resolutions.
