  This is a TensorFlow* version of "densenet-169" model, one of the DenseNet group
  of models designed to perform image classification. The weights were converted from
  DenseNet-Keras Models. For details, see repository <https://github.com/pudae/tensorflow-densenet/>
  and paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993>.
