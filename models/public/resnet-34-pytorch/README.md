# resnet-34-pytorch

## Use Case and High-Level Description

ResNet 34 is image classification model pre-trained on ImageNet dataset. This
is PyTorch\* implementation based on architecture described in paper ["Deep Residual
Learning for Image Recognition"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) in TorchVision
package (see [here](https://github.com/pytorch/vision)).

The model input is a blob that consists of a single image of `1, 3, 224, 224`
in `RGB` order.

The model output is typical object classifier for the 1000 different classifications
matching with those in the ImageNet database.

## Input

### Original model

Image, name - `data`,  shape - `1, 3, 224, 224`, format is `B, C, H, W`, where:

- `B` - batch size
- `C` - channel
- `H` - height
- `W` - width

Channel order is `RGB`.
Mean values - [123.675, 116.28, 103.53], scale values - [58.395, 57.12, 57.375].

### Converted model

Image, name - `data`,  shape - `1, 3, 224, 224`, format is `B, C, H, W`, where:

- `B` - batch size
- `C` - channel
- `H` - height
- `W` - width

Channel order is `BGR`

## Output

### Original model

Object classifier according to ImageNet classes, name - `prob`,  shape - `1, 1000`, output data format is `B, C`, where:

- `B` - batch size
- `C` - predicted probabilities for each class in [0, 1] range

### Converted model

Object classifier according to ImageNet classes, name - `prob`,  shape - `1, 1000`, output data format is `B, C`, where:

- `B` - batch size
- `C` - predicted probabilities for each class in [0, 1] range

## Download a Model and Convert it into Inference Engine Format

You can download models and if necessary convert them into Inference Engine format using the [Model Downloader and other automation tools](../../../tools/downloader/README.md) as shown in the examples below.

An example of using the Model Downloader:
```
python3 <omz_dir>/tools/downloader/downloader.py --name <model_name>
```

An example of using the Model Converter:
```
python3 <omz_dir>/tools/downloader/converter.py --name <model_name>
```
