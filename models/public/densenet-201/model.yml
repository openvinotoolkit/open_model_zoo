  The "densenet-201" model is also one of the DenseNet <https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993>
  group of models designed to perform image classification. The main difference with
  the "densenet-121" model is the size and accuracy of the model. The "densenet-201"
  is larger at over 77MB in size vs the "densenet-121" model's roughly 31MB size.
  Originally trained on Torch, the authors converted them into Caffe* format. All
  the DenseNet models have been pretrained on the ImageNet image database. For details
  about this family of models, check out the repository <https://github.com/shicai/DenseNet-Caffe>.

  The model input is a blob that consists of a single image of 1x3x224x224 in BGR
  order. The BGR mean values need to be subtracted as follows: [103.94, 116.78, 123.68]
  before passing the image blob into the network. In addition, values must be divided
  by 0.017.

  The model output for "densenet-201" is the typical object classifier output for
  the 1000 different classifications matching those in the ImageNet database.
