  The "mtcnn-r" model is one of the mtcnn <https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02878>
  group of models designed to perform face detection. Short for "Multi-task Cascaded
  Convolutional Neural Network", it is implemented using the Caffe* framework. The
  "r" designation indicates that this model is the "refine" network intended to refine
  the data returned as output from the "proposal" "mtcnn-p" network. For details about
  this family of models, check out the repository <https://github.com/DuinoDu/mtcnn>.

  The model input is a blob with a vector containing the first pass of face data,
  as returned by the "mtcnn-p" model. The mean values need to be subtracted as follows:
  [127.5, 127.5, 127.5] before passing the image blob into the network. In addition,
  values must be divided by 0.0078125.

  The model output is a blob with a vector containing the refined face data. If there
  are no faces detected by the refine pass, no further processing is needed. Otherwise,
  you will typically use this output as input to the "mtcnn-o" model.
