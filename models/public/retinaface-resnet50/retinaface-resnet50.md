# retinaface-resnet50

## Use Case and High-Level Description
RetinaFace-R50 is a medium size model with ResNet50 backbone for Face Localization. It can output face bounding boxes and five facial landmarks in a single forward pass. More details provided in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00641) and [repository](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/tree/master/RetinaFace)

Average Precision (AP) is defined as an area under the
[precision/recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall)
curve. All numbers were evaluated by taking into account only faces bigger than
64 x 64 pixels.

Accuracy validation approach different from described in the original repo.

## Input

### Original model:
Image, name: `data`,  shape: `1,3,640,640`, format: `B,C,H,W`, where:

- `B` - batch size
- `C` - channel
- `H` - height
- `W` - width

Channel order is `RGB`.

### Converted model:
Image, name: `data`,  shape: `1,3,640,640`, format: `B,C,H,W`, where:

- `B` - batch size
- `C` - channel
- `H` - height
- `W` - width

Channel order is `BGR`.

## Output

### Original model
Model outputs are floating points tensors:
1.  name: `face_rpn_cls_prob_reshape_stride32`, shape: `1,4, 20, 20`, format: `[B, Ax2, H, W]`, represents detection scores from Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) level with stride 32 for 2 classes: background and face.

2.  name: `face_rpn_bbox_stride32`,  shape: `1,8,20,20`, format: `[B, Ax4, H, W]`, represents *detection box deltas* from Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) level with stride 32

3. name: `face_rpn_landmark_pred_stride32`, shape: `1,20,20,20`, format: `[B, Ax10, H, W]`, represents *facial landmarks* from Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) level with stride 32.

4. name: `face_rpn_cls_prob_reshape_stride16`, shape: `1,4,40,40`, format: `[B, Ax2, H, W]`, represents detection scores from Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) level with stride 16 for 2 classes: background and face.

5. name: `face_rpn_bbox_stride16`,  shape: `1,8,40,40`, format: `[B, Ax4, H, W]`, represents *detection box deltas* from Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) level with stride 16.

6. name: `face_rpn_landmark_pred_stride16`, shape: `1,20,40,40`, format: `[B, Ax10, H, W]`, represents facial landmarks from Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) level with stride 16.

7. name: `face_rpn_cls_prob_reshape_stride16`, shape: `1,4,80,80`, format: `[B, Ax2, H, W]`, represents detection scores from Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) level with stride 8 for 2 classes: background and face.

8. name: `face_rpn_bbox_stride16`,  shape: `1,8,80,80`, format: `[B, Ax4, H, W]`, represents detection box deltas from Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) level with stride 8.

9. name: `face_rpn_landmark_pred_stride16`, shape: `1,20,80,80`, format: `[B, Ax10, H, W]`, represents facial landmarks from Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) level with stride 8.
   
For each output format:
- `B` - batch size
- `A` - number of anchors
- `H` - feature height
- `W` - feature width

Detection box deltas have format `[dx, dy, dh, dw]`, where:
- `(dx, dy)` - regression for left-upper corner of bounding box,
- `(dh, dw)` - regression by height and width of bounding box.

Facial landmarks have format `[x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4, x5, y5]`, where:
- `(x1, y1)` - coordinates of left eye
- `(x2, y2)` - coordinates of rights eye
- `(x3, y3)` - coordinates of nose
- `(x4, y4)` - coordinates of left mouth corner
- `(x5, y5)` - coordinates of right mouth corner

### Converted model
The converted model has the same parameters as the original model.
