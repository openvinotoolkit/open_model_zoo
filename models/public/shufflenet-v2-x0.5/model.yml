  Shufflenet V2 x0.5 is a light-weight classification model based on "channel split"
  and "channel shuffle" operations. This is Caffe* implementation based on architecture
  described in paper "ShuffleNet V2: Practical Guidelines for Efficient CNN Architecture
  Design" <https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11164>. For details about implementation, check
  out the repository <https://github.com/miaow1988/ShuffleNet_V2_pytorch_caffe>. The
  model was pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset.

  The model input is a blob that consists of a single image of "1, 3, 224, 224" in
  "RGB" order.

  The model output is typical object classifier for the 1000 different classifications
  matching with those in the ImageNet dataset.
