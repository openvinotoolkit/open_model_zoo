  The "ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco" model is a Single-Shot multibox Detection (SSD) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04381>
  network intended to perform object detection. The model has been trained from the
  Common Objects in Context (COCO) image dataset.

  The model input is a blob that consists of a single image of "1, 3, 300, 300" in
  "RGB" order.

  The model output is a typical vector containing the tracked object data, as previously
  described. Note that the "class_id" data is now significant and should be used to
  determine the classification for any detected object.
