  The "octave-resnet-26-0.25" model is a modification of "resnet-26" <https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385>
  with Octave convolutions from Drop an Octave: Reducing Spatial Redundancy in Convolutional
  Neural Networks with Octave Convolution <https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05049> with
  "alpha=0.25". Like the original model, this model is designed for image classification.
  For details about family of Octave Convolution models, check out the repository
  <https://github.com/facebookresearch/OctConv>.

  The model input is a blob that consists of a single image of "1, 3, 224, 224" in
  "RGB" order. Before passing the image blob into the network, subtract RGB mean values
  as follows: [124, 117, 104]. In addition, values must be divided by 0.0167.

  The model output for "octave-resnet-26-0.25" is a typical object-classifier output
  for 1000 different classifications matching those in the ImageNet database.
