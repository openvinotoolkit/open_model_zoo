# resnest-50

## Use Case and High-Level Description

ResNeSt-50 is image classification model pretrained on ImageNet dataset. ResNeSt is stacked in ResNet-style from modular Split-Attention blocks that enables attention across feature-map groups.

The model input is a blob that consists of a single image of "1x3x224x224" in RGB order.

The model output is typical object classifier for the 1000 different classifications  matching with those in the ImageNet database.

## Performance

## Input

### Original model

Image, name - `data`,  shape - `1,3,224,224`, format is `B,C,H,W` where:

- `B` - batch size
- `C` - channel
- `H` - height
- `W` - width

Channel order is `RGB`.
Mean values - [123.675,116.28,103.53], scale values - [58.395,57.12,57.375].

### Converted model

Image, name - `data`,  shape - `1,3,224,224`, format is `B,C,H,W` where:

- `B` - batch size
- `C` - channel
- `H` - height
- `W` - width

Channel order is `BGR`.

## Output

### Original model

Object classifier according to ImageNet classes, name - `prob`,  shape - `1,1000`, output data format is `B,C` where:

- `B` - batch size
- `C` - Predicted probabilities for each class in  [0, 1] range

### Converted model

The converted model has the same parameters as the original model.
