  The "ssd_resnet50_v1_fpn_coco" model is a SSD FPN object detection architecture
  based on ResNet-50. The model has been trained from the Common Objects in Context
  (COCO) image dataset. For details see the repository <https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection>
  and paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002>.
