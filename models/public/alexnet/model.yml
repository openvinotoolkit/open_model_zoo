  The "alexnet" model is designed to perform image classification. Just like other
  common classification models, the "alexnet" model has been pretrained on the ImageNet
  image database. For details about this model, check out the paper <http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf>.

  The model input is a blob that consists of a single image of 1x3x227x227 in BGR
  order. The BGR mean values need to be subtracted as follows: [104, 117, 123] before
  passing the image blob into the network.

  The model output for "alexnet" is the usual object classifier output for the 1000
  different classifications matching those in the ImageNet database.
