  The "alexnet" model is designed to perform image classification. Just like other
  common classification models, the "alexnet" model has been pre-trained on the ImageNet
  image database. For details about this model, check out the paper <https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2012/file/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Paper.pdf>.

  The model input is a blob that consists of a single image of "1, 3, 227, 227" in
  "BGR" order. The BGR mean values need to be subtracted as follows: [104, 117, 123]
  before passing the image blob into the network.

  The model output for "alexnet" is the usual object classifier output for the 1000
  different classifications matching those in the ImageNet database.
