  The "mobilenet-ssd" model is a Single-Shot multibox Detection (SSD) network intended
  to perform object detection. This model is implemented using the Caffe* framework.
  For details about this model, check out the repository <https://github.com/chuanqi305/MobileNet-SSD>.

  The model input is a blob that consists of a single image of 1x3x300x300 in BGR
  order, also like the "densenet-121" model. The BGR mean values need to be subtracted
  as follows: [127.5, 127.5, 127.5] before passing the image blob into the network.
  In addition, values must be divided by 0.007843.

  The model output is a typical vector containing the tracked object data, as previously
  described.
