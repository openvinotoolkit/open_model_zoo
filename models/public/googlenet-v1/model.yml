  The "googlenet-v1" model is the first of the Inception <https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07261>
  family of models designed to perform image classification. Like the other Inception
  models, the "googlenet-v1" model has been pretrained on the ImageNet image database.
  For details about this family of models, check out the paper.

  The model input is a blob that consists of a single image of 1x3x224x224 in BGR
  order.  The BGR mean values need to be subtracted as follows: [104.0,117.0,123.0]
  before passing the image blob into the network.

  The model output for "googlenet-v1" is the typical object classifier output for
  the 1000 different classifications matching those in the ImageNet database.
