# googlenet-v1

## Use Case and High-Level Description

The `googlenet-v1` model is the first of the [Inception](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07261) family of models designed to perform image classification. Like the other Inception models, the `googlenet-v1` model has been pretrained on the ImageNet image database. For details about this family of models, check out the paper.

The model input is a blob that consists of a single image of 1x3x224x224 in BGR order.  The BGR mean values need to be subtracted as follows: [104.0,117.0,123.0] before passing the image blob into the network.

The model output for `googlenet-v1` is the typical object classifier output for the 1000 different classifications matching those in the ImageNet database.

## Performance

## Input

### Original model

Image, name - `data`,  shape - `1,3,224,224`, format is `B,C,H,W` where:

- `B` - batch size
- `C` - channel
- `H` - height
- `W` - width

Channel order is `BGR`.
Mean values - [104.0,117.0,123.0]

### Converted model

Image, name - `data`,  shape - `1,3,224,224`, format is `B,C,H,W` where:

- `B` - batch size
- `C` - channel
- `H` - height
- `W` - width

Channel order is `BGR`

## Output

### Original model

Object classifier according to ImageNet classes, name - `prob`,  shape - `1,1000`, output data format is `B,C` where:

- `B` - batch size
- `C` - Predicted probabilities for each class in  [0, 1] range

### Converted model

Object classifier according to ImageNet classes, name - `prob`,  shape - `1,1000`, output data format is `B,C` where:

- `B` - batch size
- `C` - Predicted probabilities for each class in  [0, 1] range
