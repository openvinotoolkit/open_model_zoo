  The "vgg16" model is one of the vgg <https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556> models designed
  to perform image classification in Caffe*format.

  The model input is a blob that consists of a single image of "1, 3, 224, 224" in
  "BGR" order. The BGR mean values need to be subtracted as follows: [103.939, 116.779,
  123.68] before passing the image blob into the network.

  The model output for "vgg16" is the typical object classifier output for the 1000
  different classifications matching those in the ImageNet database.
