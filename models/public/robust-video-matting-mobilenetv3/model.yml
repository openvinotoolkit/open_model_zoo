  The "robust-video-matting-mobilenetv3" model is a robust high-resolution human video matting
  method that uses a recurrent architecture to exploit temporal information in videos
  and achieves significant improvements in temporal coherence and matting quality.
  This model is pre-trained in PyTorch* framework and converted to ONNX* format. More
  details provided in the paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.11515>. Backbone is MobileNetV3.
  For details see the repository <https://github.com/PeterL1n/RobustVideoMatting>.
  For details regarding export to ONNX see the instruction <https://github.com/DmitriySidnev/RobustVideoMatting#export-to-onnx>.
