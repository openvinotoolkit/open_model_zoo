# midasnet

## Use Case and High-Level Description

MidasNet is a model for monocular depth estimation trained by mixing several datasets;
as described in the following paper:
"Towards Robust Monocular Depth Estimation: Mixing Datasets for Zero-Shot Cross-Dataset Transfer"
<https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01341>

The model input is a blob that consists of a single image of "1x3x384x384" in `RGB` order.

The model output is an inverse depth map that is defined up to an unknown scale factor.

> **NOTE**: Originally the model weights are stored at [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Jf7qRG9N8IW8CaZ7gPisO5RtlLl63mNA),
which is unstable to download from due to weights size. Weights were additionally uploaded to
[https://download.01.org/opencv/public_models](https://download.01.org/opencv/public_models),
OpenVINO [Model Downloader](../../../tools/downloader/README.md) uses this location for downloading.
