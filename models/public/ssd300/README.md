# ssd300

## Use Case and High-Level Description

The `ssd300` model is the Caffe\* framework implementation of [Single-Shot multibox Detection (SSD)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325) algorithm with 300x300 input resolution and `VGG-16` backbone. The network intended to perform visual object detection. This model is pretrained on VOC2007 + VOC2012 + COCO dataset and is able to detect 20 [PASCAL VOC2007](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2007/) object classes:

- Person: person
- Animal: bird, cat, cow, dog, horse, sheep
- Vehicle: aeroplane, bicycle, boat, bus, car, motorbike, train
- Indoor: bottle, chair, dining table, potted plant, sofa, tv/monitor

Mapping model labels to class names provided in `<omz_dir>/data/dataset_classes/voc_20cl_bkgr.txt` file.

## Input

### Original model

Image, name - ` data`, shape - `1, 3, 300, 300`, format is `B, C, H, W`, where:

- `B` - batch size
- `C` - channel
- `H` - height
- `W` - width

Channel order is `BGR`.
Mean values - [104.0, 117.0, 123.0]

### Converted model

Image, name - ` data`, shape - `1, 3, 300, 300`, format is `B, C, H, W`, where:

- `B` - batch size
- `C` - channel
- `H` - height
- `W` - width

Channel order is `BGR`.

## Output

### Original model

The array of detection summary info, name - `detection_out`, shape - `1, 1, 200, 7` in the format `1, 1, N, 7`, where `N` is the number of detected bounding boxes. For each detection, the description has the format:
[`image_id`, `label`, `conf`, `x_min`, `y_min`, `x_max`, `y_max`], where:

- `image_id` - ID of the image in the batch
- `label` - predicted class ID (1..20 - PASCAL VOC defined class ids). Mapping to class names provided by `<omz_dir>/data/dataset_classes/voc_20cl_bkgr.txt` file.
- `conf` - confidence for the predicted class, in [0, 1] range
- (`x_min`, `y_min`) - coordinates of the top left bounding box corner (coordinates are in normalized format, in range [0, 1])
- (`x_max`, `y_max`) - coordinates of the bottom right bounding box corner (coordinates are in normalized format, in range [0, 1])

### Converted model

[`image_id`, `label`, `conf`, `x_min`, `y_min`, `x_max`, `y_max`], where:

- `conf` - confidence for the predicted class in [0, 1] range
- (`x_min`, `y_min`) - coordinates of the top left bounding box corner (coordinates are in normalized format, in range [0, 1])
- (`x_max`, `y_max`) - coordinates of the bottom right bounding box corner (coordinates are in normalized format, in range [0, 1])
