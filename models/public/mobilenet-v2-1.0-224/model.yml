  "mobilenet-v2-1.0-224" is one of MobileNet models, which are small, low-latency,
  low-power, and parameterized to meet the resource constraints of a variety of use
  cases. They can be used for classification, detection, embeddings, and segmentation
  like other popular large-scale models. For details, see the paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861>.
