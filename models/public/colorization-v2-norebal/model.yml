    The colorization-v2-norebal model is one of the colorization
    group of models designed to perform image colorization. For details
    about this family of models, check out the repository - https://github.com/richzhang/colorization.

    This model differs from model `colorization-v2` in that metrics did not take into account
    balancing of rare classes during training.

    Model consumes as input L-channel of LAB-image.
    Model give as output predict A- and B-channels of LAB-image.
