# repvgg-a0

## Use Case and High-Level Description

RepVGG-A0 is one of the RepVGG image classification models pre-trained on ImageNet dataset. RepVGG is architecture of convolutional neural network, which has a VGG-like inference-time body and a structural re-parameterization technique. The 3x3 layers are arranged into five stages. RepVGG-A stages have 1, 2, 4, 14, 1 layers respectively. The layer width for these models is determined by uniform scaling the classic width setting of [64a, 128a, 256a, 512b]. RepVGG-A0 model has multipliers a = 0.75 and b = 2.5.

The model input is a blob that consists of a single image of `1, 3, 224, 224` in `RGB` order.

The model output is typical object classifier for the 1000 different classifications matching with those in the ImageNet database.
