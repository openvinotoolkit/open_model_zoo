  The "anti-spoof-mn3" model is an anti-spoofing binary classifier based on the MobileNetV3
  <https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02244>, trained on the CelebA-Spoof dataset <https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.12342>.
  It's a small, light model, trained to predict whether or not a spoof RGB image given
  to the input. A lot of advanced techniques have been tried and selected the best
  suit options for the task. For details see original repository <https://github.com/kprokofi/light-weight-face-anti-spoofing>.
