description: >-
  A human gesture recognition model for the Jester dataset recognition scenario (gesture-level
  recognition). The model uses an S3D framework with MobileNet V3 backbone. Please
  refer to the Jester <https://20bn.com/datasets/jester> dataset specification to
  see the list of gestures that are recognized by this model.

  The model accepts a stack of frames (8 frames) sampled with a constant frame rate
  (15 FPS) and produces a prediction on the input clip.
