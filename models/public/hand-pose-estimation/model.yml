  Hand pose estimation model based on "Hand Keypoint Detection in Single Images using Multiview Bootstrapping"
  <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.07809.pdf> papers.

  The model input is a blob that consists of a single image of "1x3x368x368" in
  BGR order.

  The model outputs is heatmap blob, which contains coordinates keypoint heatmaps.
