# dla-34

## Use Case and High-Level Description

The `dla-34` model is one of the [DLA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06484)
models designed to perform image classification. This model was pre-trained in PyTorch\*. All DLA (Deep Layer Aggregation) classification models have been pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. For details about this family of models, check out the [Code for the CVPR Paper "Deep Layer Aggregation"](https://github.com/ucbdrive/dla).

| MParams          | 15.7344        |
| Source framework | PyTorch\*      |

## Accuracy

| Metric | Original model | Converted model |
| ------ | -------------- | --------------- |
| Top 1  | 74.64%         | 74.64%          |
| Top 5  | 92.06%         | 92.06%          |

## Input

### Original model

Image, name - `data`,  shape - `1, 3, 224, 224`, format is `B, C, H, W`, where:

- `B` - batch size
- `C` - channel
- `H` - height
- `W` - width

Channel order is `RGB`.
Mean values - [123.675, 116.28, 103.53], scale values - [58.395, 57.12, 57.375].

### Converted model

Image, name - `data`,  shape - `1, 3, 224, 224`, format is `B, C, H, W`, where:

- `B` - batch size
- `C` - channel
- `H` - height
- `W` - width

Channel order is `BGR`

## Output

### Original model

Object classifier according to ImageNet classes, name - `prob`,  shape - `1, 1000`, output data format is `B, C`, where:

- `B` - batch size
- `C` - predicted probabilities for each class in  [0, 1] range

### Converted model

Object classifier according to ImageNet classes, name - `prob`,  shape - `1, 1000`, output data format is `B, C`, where:

- `B` - batch size
- `C` - predicted probabilities for each class in  [0, 1] range

## Download a Model and Convert it into Inference Engine Format

You can download models and if necessary convert them into Inference Engine format using the [Model Downloader and other automation tools](../../../tools/downloader/README.md) as shown in the examples below.

An example of using the Model Downloader:
```
python3 <omz_dir>/tools/downloader/downloader.py --name <model_name>
```

An example of using the Model Converter:
```
python3 <omz_dir>/tools/downloader/converter.py --name <model_name>
```
