  The "ssd512" model is a Single-Shot multibox Detection <SSD> <https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325>
  network intended to perform face detection. This model is implemented using the
  Caffe*framework. For details about this model, check out the repository <https://github.com/weiliu89/caffe/tree/ssd>.

  The model input is a blob that consists of a single image of 1x3x512x512 in BGR
  order. The BGR mean values need to be subtracted as follows: [104.0,117.0,123.0]
  before passing the image blob into the network.

  The model output is a typical vector containing the tracked object data, as previously
  described.
