# ctdet_coco_dlav0_512

## Use Case and High-Level Description

CenterNet object detection model `ctdet_coco_dlav0_512` originally trained on PyTorch\*
then converted to ONNX\* format. CenterNet models an object as a single point - the center point of its bounding box
and uses keypoint estimation to find center points and regresses to object size.
For details see [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07850), [repository](https://github.com/xingyizhou/CenterNet/).

### Steps to Reproduce PyTorch to ONNX Conversion
Model is provided in ONNX format, which was obtained by the following steps.

1. Clone the original repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/xingyizhou/CenterNet
cd CenterNet
```
2. Checkout the commit that the conversion was tested on:
```sh
git checkout 8ef87b4
```
3. Apply the `pytorch-onnx.patch` patch
```sh
git apply /path/to/pytorch-onnx.patch
```
4. Follow the original [installation steps](https://github.com/xingyizhou/CenterNet/blob/8ef87b4/readme/INSTALL.md)
5. Download the [pretrained weights](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18yBxWOlhTo32_swSug_HM4q3BeWgxp_N/view)
6. Run
```sh
python convert.py ctdet --load_model /path/to/downloaded/weights.pth --exp_id coco_dlav0_512 --arch dlav0_34 --input_res 512 --gpus -1
```

## Performance

## Input

### Original Model

Image, name: `input.1`, shape: [1x3x512x512], format: [BxCxHxW]
where:

   - B - batch size
   - C - number of channels
   - H - image height
   - W - image width

Expected color order: BGR.
   Mean values: [104.04, 113.985, 119.85], scale values: [73.695, 69.87, 70.89].

### Converted Model

Image, name: `input.1`, shape: [1x3x512x512], format: [BxCxHxW]
where:

   - B - batch size
   - C - number of channels
   - H - image height
   - W - image width

Expected color order: BGR.

## Output

1. Object center points heatmap, name: `508`. Contains predicted objects center point, for each of the 80 categories, according to MSCOCO\* dataset version with 80 categories of objects, without background label.
2. Object size output, name: `511`. Contains predicted width and height for each object.
3. Regression output, name: `514`. Contains offsets for each prediction.
