  The `googlenet-v4-tf` model is the most recent of the Inception <https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07261>
  family of models designed to perform image classification. Like the other Inception
  models, the `googlenet-v4-tf` model has been pretrained on the ImageNet image database.
  For details about this family of models, check out the paper.
