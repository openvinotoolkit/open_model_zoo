# hifi-gan

## Use Case and High-Level Description

HiFi-GAN is a model for the text-to-speech task originally trained in PyTorch\*
then converted to ONNX\* format. The model was trained on LJSpeech dataset.
HiFi-GAN performs waveform regression from mel-spectrogram.
For details see [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05646), [repository](https://github.com/jik876/hifi-gan).

## ONNX Models

We provide pre-trained models in ONNX format for user convenience.

## Composite model specification

| Metric                          | Value                                     |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Source framework                | PyTorch\*                                 |

### Accuracy

Subjective

## HiFi-GAN model specification

The HiFi-GAN model accepts mel-spectrogram and produces normalized raw audio form.

| Metric                          | Value                                     |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| GOPs                            | 90.82                                      |
| MParams                         | 13.93                                       |

### Input

Mel-spectrogram, name: `mel`, shape: `1, 80, 128`, format: `B, C, T`, where:

- `B` - batch size
- `T` - time in mel-spectrogram
- `C` - number of mels in mel-spectrogram

### Output

Processed mel-spectrogram, name: `audio`, shape: `1, 1, 32768`, format: `B, C, T`, where:

   - `B` - batch size
   - `T` - time in audio (equal to `time in mel spectrogram` * `hop_length`)
   - `C` - extra dimension (equal to one).
