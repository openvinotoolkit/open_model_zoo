# yolo-v4-tf

## Use Case and High-Level Description

YOLO v4 is a real-time object detection model based on ["YOLOv4: Optimal Speed and Accuracy of Object Detection"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10934) paper. It was implemented in Keras\* framework and converted to TensorFlow\* framework. For details see [repository](https://github.com/david8862/keras-YOLOv3-model-set). This model was pre-trained on [Common Objects in Context (COCO)](https://cocodataset.org/#home) dataset with 80 classes.

## Output

### Original model

1. The array of detection summary info, name - `conv2d_93/BiasAdd`, shape - `1, 76, 76, 255`. The anchor values are `12,16, 19,36, 40,28`.

2. The array of detection summary info, name - `conv2d_101/BiasAdd`, shape - `1, 38, 38, 255`. The anchor values are `36,75, 76,55, 72,146`.

3. The array of detection summary info, name - `conv2d_109/BiasAdd`, shape - `1, 19, 19, 255`. The anchor values are `142,110, 192,243, 459,401`.

For each case format is `B, Cx, Cy, N*85,`, where:

- `B` - batch size
- `Cx`, `Cy` - cell index
- `N` - number of detection boxes for cell

Detection box has format [`x`, `y`, `h`, `w`, `box_score`, `class_no_1`, ..., `class_no_80`], where:

- (`x`, `y`) - raw coordinates of box center, apply [sigmoid function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function) to get relative to the cell coordinates
- `h`, `w` - raw height and width of box, apply [exponential function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_function) and multiply by corresponding anchors to get absolute height and width values
- `box_score` - confidence of detection box, apply [sigmoid function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function) to get confidence in [0, 1] range
- `class_no_1`, ..., `class_no_80` - probability distribution over the classes in logits format, apply [sigmoid function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function) and multiply by obtained confidence value to get confidence of each class

The model was trained on [Common Objects in Context (COCO)](https://cocodataset.org/#home) dataset version with 80 categories of object. Mapping to class names provided in `<omz_dir>/data/dataset_classes/coco_80cl.txt` file.
