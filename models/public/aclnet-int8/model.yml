  The "AclNet-int8" model is quantized and fine-tuned with NNCF variant of AclNet
  <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo/blob/master/models/public/aclnet/aclnet.md>
  model, which is designed to perform sound classification. The "AclNet-int8" model
  is trained on an internal dataset of environmental sounds for 53 different classes,
  listed in file "<omz_dir>/data/dataset_classes/aclnet.txt". For details about the
  model, see this paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06669>.

  The model input is a segment of PCM audio samples in "N, C, 1, L" format.

  The model output for "AclNet-int8" is the sound classifier output for the 53 different
  environmental sound classes from the internal sound database.
