## Input

### Original Model

Image, name: `data`,  shape: `1,3,224,224`, format is `B,C,H,W` where:

- `B` - batch size
- `C` - channel
- `H` - height
- `W` - width

Channel order is `BGR`. 
Mean values: [104, 117, 123].

### Converted Model

Image, name: `data`,  shape: `1,3,224,224`, format is `B,C,H,W` where:

- `B` - batch size
- `C` - channel
- `H` - height
- `W` - width

Channel order is `BGR`.

## Output

### Original Model

Object classifier according to ImageNet classes, name: `prob`,  shape: `1,1000`, output data format is `B,C` where:

- `B` - batch size
- `C` - predicted probabilities for each class in the range [0, 1]

### Converted Model

Object classifier according to ImageNet classes, name: `prob`,  shape: `1,1000`, output data format is `B,C` where:

- `B` - batch size
- `C` - predicted probabilities for each class in the range [0, 1]
