# bert-base-ner

## Use Case and High-Level Description

`bert-base-ner` is a fine-tuned BERT model that is ready to use for Named Entity Recognition and achieves state-of-the-art performance for the NER task. It has been trained to recognize four types of entities: location (LOC), organizations (ORG), person (PER) and Miscellaneous (MISC).

Specifically, this model is a bert-base-cased model that was fine-tuned on the English version of the standard [CoNLL-2003 Named Entity Recognition](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W03-0419) dataset.
For details about the original model, check out
[BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805),
[HuggingFace's Transformers: State-of-the-art Natural Language Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03771) papers, [repository](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) and [model card](https://huggingface.co/dslim/bert-base-NER).

Tokenization occurs using the BERT tokenizer (see the demo code for implementation details) and the enclosed `vocab.txt` dictionary file.

|-------------------|-----------------------|
| GOps              | 22.3874               |

## Accuracy

The quality metric was calculated on CONLL-2003 Named Entity Recognition dataset (dev set). Input sequences were padded to 128 symbols.

Use `accuracy_check [...] --model_attributes <path_to_folder_with_downloaded_model>` to specify the path to additional model attributes. `path_to_folder_with_downloaded_model` is a path to the folder, where the current model is downloaded by [Model Downloader](../../../tools/model_tools/README.md) tool.

## Input

### Original model

1. Token IDs, name: `input_ids`, shape: `1, 128`.
Token IDs is sequence of integer values that is representing the tokenized input sentence.
The sequence structure is as follows (`[CLS]` and `[SEP]`should be replaced by corresponding token IDs
as specified by the dictionary):
`[CLS]` + *tokenized text* + `[SEP]` + `0` (for padding to sequence length 128]

2. Input mask, name: `attention_mask`, shape: `1, 128`.
Input mask is a sequence of integer values representing the mask of valid values in the input.
The values of this input are equal to:
    * `1` at positions corresponding to the `[CLS]` + *tokenized text* + `[SEP]` part of the `input_ids`  (i.e. all positions except those containing the padding), and
    * `0` at all other positions

3. Token types,  name: `token_type_ids`, shape: `1, 128`.
Token types is sequence of integer values representing the segmentation of the `input_ids`.
The values are equal to `0` at all other positions (all text belongs to single segment)

* `[CLS]` is a special symbol added in front of the text.
* `[SEP]` is a special separator added at the end of the text.

### Converted model

 Converted model has the same inputs like in original.

## Output

### Original model

Token classifier, name: `output`, shape: `1, 128, 9`
floating point-valued logit scores vectors that represents probability of belonging each token to 9 classes:
