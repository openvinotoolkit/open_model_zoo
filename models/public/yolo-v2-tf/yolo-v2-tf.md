# yolo-v2-tf

## Use Case and High-Level Description

YOLO v2 is a real-time object detection model implemented with Keras\* from this [repository](https://github.com/allanzelener/YAD2K) and converted to TensorFlow\* framework. This model was pretrained on COCO\* dataset with 80 classes.

## Conversion

1. Download or clone the official [repository](https://github.com/allanzelener/YAD2K) (tested on `a42c760` commit).
2. Follow the instructions in the README.md file in that repository to get original model and convert it to Keras\* format.
3. Convert the produced model to protobuf format.

    1. Get conversion script from [repository](https://github.com/amir-abdi/keras_to_tensorflow):
        ```buildoutcfg
        git clone https://github.com/amir-abdi/keras_to_tensorflow
        ```
    1. (Optional) Checkout the commit that the conversion was tested on:
        ```
        git checkout c84150
        ```
    1. Apply `keras_to_tensorflow.py.patch`:
        ```
        git apply keras_to_tensorflow.py.patch
        ```
    1. Run script:
        ```
        python keras_to_tensorflow.py --input_model=<model_in>.h5 --output_model=<model_out>.pb
        ```

## Output

### Original model

The array of detection summary info, name - `conv2d_23/BiasAdd`,  shape - `1,19,19,425`, format is `B,Cx,Cy,N*85` where
- `B` - batch size
- `Cx`, `Cy` - cell index
- `N` - number of detection boxes for cell

Detection box has format [`x`,`y`,`h`,`w`,`box_score`,`class_no_1`, ..., `class_no_80`], where:
- (`x`,`y`) - raw coordinates of box center, apply [sigmoid function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function) to get coordinates relative to the cell
- `h`,`w` - raw height and width of box, apply [exponential function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_function) and multiply by corresponding anchors to get height and width values relative to the cell
- `box_score` - confidence of detection box, apply [sigmoid function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function) to get confidence in [0,1] range
- `class_no_1`,...,`class_no_80` - probability distribution over the classes in logits format, apply [softmax function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function) and multiply by obtained confidence value to get confidence of each class

The anchor values are `0.57273,0.677385, 1.87446,2.06253, 3.33843,5.47434, 7.88282,3.52778, 9.77052,9.16828`.

### Converted model

The array of detection summary info, name - `conv2d_23/BiasAdd/YoloRegion`,  shape - `1,153425`, which could be reshaped to `1,425,19,19` with format `B,N*85,Cx,Cy` where
- `B` - batch size
- `N` - number of detection boxes for cell
- `Cx`, `Cy` - cell index

Detection box has format [`x`,`y`,`h`,`w`,`box_score`,`class_no_1`, ..., `class_no_80`], where:
- (`x`,`y`) - coordinates of box center relative to the cell
- `h`,`w` - raw height and width of box, apply [exponential function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_function) and multiply with corresponding anchors to get height and width values relative to the cell
- `box_score` - confidence of detection box in [0,1] range
- `class_no_1`,...,`class_no_80` - probability distribution over the classes in the [0,1] range, multiply by confidence value to get confidence of each class

The anchor values are `0.57273,0.677385, 1.87446,2.06253, 3.33843,5.47434, 7.88282,3.52778, 9.77052,9.16828`.
