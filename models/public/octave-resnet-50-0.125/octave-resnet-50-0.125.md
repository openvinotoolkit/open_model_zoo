# octave-resnet-50-0.125

## Use Case and High-Level Description

The `octave-resnet-50-0.125` model is a modification of ResNet-50 from [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) with octave convolutions from [Drop an Octave: Reducing Spatial Redundancy in Convolutional Neural Networks with Octave Convolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05049) with `alpha=0.125`. The model is originally designed for image classification. For details about family of Octave Convolution models, check out the  [repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/OctConv).

The model input is a blob that consists of a single image of 1x3x224x224 in RGB order. The RGB mean values need to be subtracted as follows: [124,117,104] before passing the image blob into the network. In addition, values must be divided by 0.0167.

The model output for `octave-resnet-50-0.125` is the typical object classifier output for the 1000 different classifications matching those in the ImageNet database.
