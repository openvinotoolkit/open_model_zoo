  The "octave-resnet-50-0.125" model is a modification of "resnet-50" from this paper
  <https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385> with octave convolutions from Drop an Octave:
  Reducing Spatial Redundancy in Convolutional Neural Networks with Octave Convolution
  <https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05049> with "alpha=0.125". The model is originally designed
  for image classification. For details about family of Octave Convolution models,
  check out the  repository <https://github.com/facebookresearch/OctConv>.

  The model input is a blob that consists of a single image of 1x3x224x224 in RGB
  order. The RGB mean values need to be subtracted as follows: [124,117,104] before
  passing the image blob into the network. In addition, values must be divided by
  0.0167.

  The model output for "octave-resnet-50-0.125" is the typical object classifier output
  for the 1000 different classifications matching those in the ImageNet database.
