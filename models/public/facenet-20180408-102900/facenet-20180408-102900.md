## Performance

## Input

### Original model

1. Image, name - `batch_join:0` , shape - [1x160x160x3], format [BxHxWxC],
   where:

    - B - batch size
    - H - image height
    - W - image width
    - C - number of channels

   Expected color order - RGB.
   Mean values - [127.5, 127.5, 127.5], scale factor for each channel - 128.0
2. A boolean input, manages state of the graph (train/infer), name - `phase_train`, shape - [1].

### Converted model

Image, name - `image_batch/placeholder_port_0`, shape - [1x3x160x160], format [BxCxHxW],
where:

   - B - batch size
   - C - number of channels
   - H - image height
   - W - image width

Expected color order: BGR.

## Output

### Original model

Vector of floating-point values - face embeddings, Name - `embeddings`.

### Converted model

Face embeddings, name - `InceptionResnetV1/Bottleneck/BatchNorm/Reshape_1/Normalize`, in format [B,C],
   where:
   
    - B - batch size
    - C - row-vector of 512 floating-point values - face embeddings.
