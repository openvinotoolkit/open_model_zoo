  The "squeezenet1.0" model is one of the SqueezeNet <https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07360>
  topology models, is designed to perform image classification. The SqueezeNet models
  have been pre-trained on the ImageNet image database. For details about this family
  of models, check out the repository <https://github.com/forresti/SqueezeNet>.

  The model input is a blob that consists of a single image of 1x3x227x227 in BGR
  order. The BGR mean values need to be subtracted as follows: [104, 117, 123] before
  passing the image blob into the network.

  The model output for "squeezenet1.0" is the typical object classifier output for
  the 1000 different classifications matching those in the ImageNet database.
