  The "mtcnn-r" model is one of the mtcnn <https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02878> group
  of models designed to perform face detection. Short for "Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional
  Neural Network", it is implemented using the Caffe* framework. The "r" designation
  indicates that this model is the "refine" network intended to refine the data returned
  as output from the "proposal" "mtcnn-p" network. For details about this family of
  models, check out the repository <https://github.com/DuinoDu/mtcnn>.

  The model input is a blob with a vector containing the first pass of face data,
  as returned by the "mtcnn-p" model. The mean values need to be subtracted as follows:
  [127.5, 127.5, 127.5] before passing the image blob into the network. In addition,
  values must be divided by 0.0078125.

  The model output is a blob with a vector containing the refined face data. If there
  are no faces detected by the refine pass, no further processing is needed. Otherwise,
  you will typically use this output as input to the "mtcnn-o" model.
