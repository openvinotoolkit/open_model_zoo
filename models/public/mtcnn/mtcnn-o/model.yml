  The "mtcnn-o" model is the third of the mtcnn <https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02878>
  group of models designed to perform face detection. Short for "Multi-task Cascaded
  Convolutional Neural Network", it is implemented using the Caffe* framework. The
  "o" designation indicates that this model is the "output" network intended to take
  the data returned from the "refine" "mtcnn-r" network, and transform it into the
  final output data.  For details about this family of models, check out the repository
  <https://github.com/DuinoDu/mtcnn>.

  The model input is a blob with a vector containing the refined face data, as returned
  by the "mtcnn-r" model. The mean values need to be subtracted as follows: [127.5,
  127.5, 127.5] before passing the image blob into the network. In addition, values
  must be divided by 0.0078125.

  The model output is a blob with a vector containing the output face data.
