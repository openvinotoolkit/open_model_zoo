  The "mtcnn-p" model is one of the mtcnn <https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02878> group
  of models designed to perform face detection. Short for "Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional
  Neural Network", it is implemented using the Caffe* framework. The "p" designation
  indicates that this model is the "proposal" network intended to find the initial
  set of faces. For details about this family of models, check out the repository
  <https://github.com/DuinoDu/mtcnn>.

  The model input is an image containing the data to be analyzed. The mean values
  need to be subtracted as follows: [127.5, 127.5, 127.5] before passing the image
  blob into the network. In addition, values must be divided by 0.0078125.

  The model output is a blob with a vector containing the first pass of face data.
  If there are no faces detected, no further processing is needed. Otherwise, you
  will typically use this output as input to the "mtcnn-r" model.
