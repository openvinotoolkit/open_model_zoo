## Performance

## Input

### Original model

Image, name - `data`,  shape - `1,3,224,224`, format is `B,C,H,W` where:

- `B` - batch size
- `C` - channel
- `H` - height
- `W` - width

Channel order is `BGR`.
Mean values - [104, 117, 123].

### Converted model

Image, name - `data`,  shape - `1,3,224,224`, format is `B,C,H,W` where:

- `B` - batch size
- `C` - channel
- `H` - height
- `W` - width

Channel order is `BGR`

## Output

### Original model

Object classifier according to ImageNet classes, name - `prob`,  shape - `1,1000`, output data format is `B,C` where:

- `B` - batch size
- `C` - Predicted probabilities for each class in  [0, 1] range

### Converted model

Object classifier according to ImageNet classes, name - `prob`,  shape - `1,1000`, output data format is `B,C` where:

- `B` - batch size
- `C` - Predicted probabilities for each class in  [0, 1] range
