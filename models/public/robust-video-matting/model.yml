  The "background-matting-v2" model is a high-resolution background replacement technique based on
  background matting (with MobileNetV2 backbone), where an additional frame of the background is
  captured and used in recovering the alpha matte and the foreground layer. This model is
  pre-trained in PyTorch* framework and converted to ONNX* format. More details provided in
  the paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07810>.
  For details see the repository <https://github.com/DmitriySidnev/BackgroundMattingV2>.
