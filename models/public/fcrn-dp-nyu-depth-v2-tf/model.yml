  This is a model for monocular depth estimation trained on the NYU Depth V2 dataset,
  as described in the paper Deeper Depth Prediction with Fully Convolutional Residual
  Networks <https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00373>, where it is referred to as ResNet-UpProj.
  The model input is a single color image. The model output is an inverse depth map
  that is defined up to an unknown scale factor. More details can be found in the
  following repository <https://github.com/iro-cp/FCRN-DepthPrediction>.
