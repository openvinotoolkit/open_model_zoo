  FCRN ResNet50 UpProj is a model for monocular depth estimation trained by NYU Depth V2 dataset;
  as described in the paper "Deeper Depth Prediction with Fully Convolutional Residual Networks"
  <https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00373>.
  The model input is a blob that consists of a single image of "1x228x304x3" in RGB order.
  The model output is an inverse depth map that is defined up to an unknown scale factor.
