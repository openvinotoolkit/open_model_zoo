  The "gmcnn-places2-tf" is the TensorFlow* implementation of GMCNN Image Inpainting
  model, aimed to estimate suitable pixel information to fill holes in images. "gmcnn-places2-tf"
  is trained on Places2 dataset with free-form masks. Originally redistributed as
  checkpoint files, it was converted to a frozen graph. For details see repository
  <https://github.com/shepnerd/inpainting_gmcnn>.
