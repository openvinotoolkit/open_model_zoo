  The "background-matting-mobilenetv2" model is a high-resolution background replacement
  technique based on background matting (with MobileNetV2 backbone), where an additional
  frame of the background is captured and used in recovering the alpha matte and the
  foreground layer. This model is pre-trained in PyTorch* framework and converted
  to ONNX* format. More details provided in the paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07810>.
  For details see the repository <https://github.com/PeterL1n/BackgroundMattingV2>.
  For details regarding export to ONNX see here <https://github.com/DmitriySidnev/BackgroundMattingV2/blob/master/export_onnx.py>.
