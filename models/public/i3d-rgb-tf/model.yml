  The "i3d-rgb-tf" is a model for video classification, based on paper "Quo Vadis,
  Action Recognition? A New Model and the Kinetics Dataset" <https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07750>.
  This model use RGB input stream and trained on Kinetics-400 dataset. Additionally,
  this model has initialize values from Inception v1 model pre-trained on ImageNet
  dataset.

  Originally redistributed as a checkpoint file, was converted to frozen graph.
