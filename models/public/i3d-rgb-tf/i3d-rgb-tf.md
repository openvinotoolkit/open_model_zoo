# i3d-rgb-tf

## Use Case and High-Level Description

The `i3d-rgb-tf` is a model for video classification, based on paper ["Quo Vadis, Action Recognition? A New Model and the Kinetics Dataset"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07750). This model use RGB input stream and trained on Kinetics-400\* dataset   . Additionally, this model has initialize values from Inception v1 model pretrained on ImageNet\* dataset.

Originally redistributed as a checkpoint file, was converted to frozen graph.

## Conversion

1. Clone or download original repository:

    ```
1. (Optional) Checkout the commit that the conversion was tested on:
    ```
    git checkout 0667e88
    ```
1. Install prerequisites, tested with:
    ```

    tensorflow-probability==0.4.0
    dm-sonnet==1.26
    ```
1. Copy [script](./freeze.py) to root directory of original repository and run it:
    ```
    python freeze.py
    ```

## Input

### Original Model

Video clip, name - `Placeholder`, shape - `1,79,224,224,3`, format is `B,D,H,W,C`, where:
- `B` - batch size
- `D` - duration of input clip
- `H` - height
- `W` - width
- `C` - channel

Channel order is `RGB`. Mean value - 127.5, scale value - 127.5.

### Converted Model

Video clip, name - `Placeholder`, shape - `1,79,3,224,224`, format is `B,D,C,H,W`, where:
- `B` - batch size
- `D` - duration of input clip
- `C` - channel
- `H` - height
- `W` - width

Channel order is `RGB`.

## Output

### Original Model

Action classifier according to Kinetics-400\* action classes, name - `Softmax`, shape - `1,400`, format is `B,C`, where:
- `B` - batch size
- `C` - predicted probabilities for each class in  [0, 1] range

### Converted Model

Action classifier according to Kinetics-400\* action classes, name - `Softmax`, shape - `1,400`, format is `B,C`, where:
- `B` - batch size
- `C` - predicted probabilities for each class in  [0, 1] range
