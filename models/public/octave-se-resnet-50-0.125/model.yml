  The "octave-se-resnet-50-0.125" model is a modification of "se-resnet-50" from this
  paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01507> with octave convolutions from Drop
  an Octave: Reducing Spatial Redundancy in Convolutional Neural Networks with Octave
  Convolution <https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05049> with "alpha=0.125". As origin, it's
  designed to perform image classification. For details about family of octave convolution
  models, check out the repository <https://github.com/facebookresearch/OctConv>.

  The model input is a blob that consists of a single image of 1x3x224x224 in RGB
  order. The RGB mean values need to be subtracted as follows: [124,117,104] before
  passing the image blob into the network. In addition, values must be divided by
  0.0167.

  The model output for "octave-se-resnet-50-0.125" is the typical object classifier
  output for the 1000 different classifications matching those in the ImageNet database.
