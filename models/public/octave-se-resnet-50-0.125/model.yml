  The "octave-se-resnet-50-0.125" model is a modification of "se-resnet-50" from this
  paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01507> with octave convolutions from Drop an Octave:
  Reducing Spatial Redundancy in Convolutional Neural Networks with Octave Convolution
  <https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05049> with "alpha=0.125". As origin, it's designed
  to perform image classification. For details about family of octave convolution
  models, check out the repository <https://github.com/facebookresearch/OctConv>.

  The model input is a blob that consists of a single image of "1, 3, 224, 224" in
  "RGB" order. The RGB mean values need to be subtracted as follows: [124, 117, 104]
  before passing the image blob into the network. In addition, values must be divided
  by 0.0167.

  The model output for "octave-se-resnet-50-0.125" is the typical object classifier
  output for the 1000 different classifications matching those in the ImageNet database.
