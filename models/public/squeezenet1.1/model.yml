  The "squeezenet1.1" updated version of the SqueezeNet <https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07360>
  topology. It is designed to perform image classification.  It requires 2.4x less
  computation than SqueezeNet v1.0 <../squeezenet1.0/squeezenet1.0.md> without diminishing
  accuracy. The SqueezeNet models have been pre-trained on the ImageNet image database.
  For details about this family of models, check out the repository <https://github.com/forresti/SqueezeNet>.

  The model input is a blob that consists of a single image of 1x3x227x227 in BGR
  order. The BGR mean values need to be subtracted as follows: [104, 117, 123] before
  passing the image blob into the network.

  The model output for "squeezenet1.1" is the typical object classifier output for
  the 1000 different classifications matching those in the ImageNet database.
