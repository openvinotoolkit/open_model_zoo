description: >-
  This is a vehicle reidentification model for a general scenario. It uses a whole
  car body image as an input and outputs an embedding vector to match a pair of images
  by the cosine distance. The model is based on the OmniScaleNet backbone developed
  for fast inference. A single reidentification head from the 1/16 scale feature map
  outputs an embedding vector of 512 floats.
