  The "vgg19" model is one of the vgg <https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556> models
  designed to perform image classification in Caffe* format.

  The model input is a blob that consists of a single image of 1x3x224x224 in BGR
  order. The BGR mean values need to be subtracted as follows: [103.939, 116.779,
  123.68] before passing the image blob into the network.

  The model output for "vgg19" is the typical object classifier output for the 1000
  different classifications matching those in the ImageNet database.
