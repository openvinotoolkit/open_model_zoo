    The `fast-neural-style-mosaic-onnx` model is one of the style transfer
    models designed to mix the content of an image with the style of another
    image. The model uses the method described in Perceptual Losses for
    Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution <https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08155>
    along with Instance Normalization <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.08022.pdf>.
