  The "fast-neural-style-mosaic-onnx" model is one of the style transfer models designed
  to mix the content of an image with the style of another image. The model uses the
  method described in Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution
  <https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08155> along with Instance Normalization <https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08022>.
  Original ONNX models are provided in the repository <https://github.com/onnx/models>.
