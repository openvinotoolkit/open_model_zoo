  The `inception-resnet-v2` model is one of the Inception <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.07261.pdf>
  family of models designed to perform image classification.1 Like the other Inception
  models, the `inception-resnet-v2` model has been pretrained on the ImageNet
  image database. For details about this family of models, check out the paper.

  The model input is a blob that consists of a single image of 1x3x299x299 in
  BGR order. The BGR mean values need to be subtracted as follows: [128.0,128.0,128.0]
  before passing the image blob into the network. In addition, values must be
  divided by 0.0078125.

  The model output for `inception-resnet-v2` is the typical object classifier
  output for the 1000 different classifications matching those in the ImageNet
  database.
