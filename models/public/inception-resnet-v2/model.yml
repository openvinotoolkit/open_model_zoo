  The "inception-resnet-v2" model is one of the Inception <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.07261.pdf>
  family of models designed to perform image classification.1 Like the other Inception
  models, the "inception-resnet-v2" model has been pretrained on the ImageNet image
  database. For details about this family of models, check out the paper.

  The model input is a blob that consists of a single image of 1x3x299x299 in BGR
  order. The BGR mean values need to be subtracted as follows: [128.0,128.0,128.0]
  before passing the image blob into the network. In addition, values must be divided
  by 0.0078125.

  The model output for "inception-resnet-v2" is the typical object classifier output
  for the 1000 different classifications matching those in the ImageNet database.
