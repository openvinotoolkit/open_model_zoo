  The "efficientdet-d1-tf" model is one of the EfficientDet <https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09070>
  models  designed to perform object detection. This model was pre-trained in TensorFlow*.
  All the EfficientDet models have been pre-trained on the Common Objects in Context
  (COCO) <https://cocodataset.org/#home> image database. For details about this family
  of models, check out the Google AutoML repository <https://github.com/google/automl/tree/master/efficientdet>.
