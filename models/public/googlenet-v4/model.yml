  The "googlenet-v4" model is the most recent of the Inception <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.07261.pdf>
  family of models designed to perform image classification. Like the other Inception
  models, the "googlenet-v4" model has been pretrained on the ImageNet image database.
  For details about this family of models, check out the paper.

  The model input is a blob that consists of a single image of 1x3x299x299 in BGR
  order. The BGR mean values need to be subtracted as follows: [128.0,128.0,128.0]
  before passing the image blob into the network. In addition, values must be divided
  by 0.0078125.

  The model output for "googlenet-v4" is the typical object classifier output for
  the 1000 different classifications matching those in the ImageNet database.
