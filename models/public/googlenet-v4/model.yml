  The `googlenet-v4` model is the most recent of the Inception <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.07261.pdf>
  family of models designed to perform image classification. Like the other Inception
  models, the `googlenet-v4` model has been pretrained on the ImageNet image database.
  For details about this family of models, check out the paper.

  The model input is a blob that consists of a single image of 1x3x299x299 in
  BGR order. The BGR mean values need to be subtracted as follows: [128.0,128.0,128.0]
  before passing the image blob into the network. In addition, values must be
  divided by 0.0078125.

  The model output for `googlenet-v4` is the typical object classifier output
  for the 1000 different classifications matching those in the ImageNet database.
