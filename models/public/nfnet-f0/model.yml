description: >-
  NFNet F0 is one of the image classification Normalizer-Free models pre-trained on
  the ImageNet dataset. NFNets are Normalizer-Free ResNets in which use Adaptive Gradient
  Clipping (AGC), which clips gradients based on the unit-wise ratio of gradient norms
  to parameter norms.

  F0 variant is the baseline variant with a depth pattern [1, 2, 6, 3] (indicating
  how many bottleneck blocks to allocate to each stage). Each subsequent variant has
  this depth pattern multiplied by N (where N = 1 for F0).

  The model input is a blob that consists of a single image of "1, 3, 256, 256" in
  "RGB" order.

  The model output is typical object classifier for the 1000 different classifications
  matching with those in the ImageNet database.

  paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06171>.
