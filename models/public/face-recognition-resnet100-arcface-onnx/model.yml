  The "face-recognition-resnet100-arcface-onnx" model is a deep face recognition model
  with ResNet100 backbone and ArcFace loss. ArcFace is a novel supervisor signal called
  additive angular margin which used as an additive term in the softmax loss to enhance
  the discriminative power of softmax loss. This model is pre-trained in MXNet* framework
  and converted to ONNX* format. More details provided in the paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07698>
  and repository <https://github.com/onnx/models/tree/master/vision/body_analysis/arcface>.
