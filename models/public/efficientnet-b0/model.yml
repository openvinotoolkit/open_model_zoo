  The "efficientnet-b0" model is one of the EfficientNet <https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946>
  models designed to perform image classification. This model was pre-trained in TensorFlow*.
  All the EfficientNet models have been pre-trained on the ImageNet image database.
  For details about this family of models, check out the TensorFlow Cloud TPU repository
