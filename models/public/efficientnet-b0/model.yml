  The "efficientnet-b0" model is one of the EfficientNet <https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946>
  models  designed to perform image classification. This model was pretrained in TensorFlow*.
  All the EfficientNet models have been pretrained on the ImageNet* image database.
  For details about this family of models, check out the TensorFlow Cloud TPU repository
