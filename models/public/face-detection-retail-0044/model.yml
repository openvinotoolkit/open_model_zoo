description: >-
  Face detector based on SqueezeNet light (half-channels) as a backbone with a single
  SSD for indoor/outdoor scenes shot by a front-facing camera. The backbone consists
  of fire modules to reduce the number of computations. The single SSD head from 1/16
  scale feature map has nine clustered prior boxes.
