  This is TensoFlow version of OpenPose algorithm, used for multi-person
  human pose estimation. The model is based on VGG pretrained network,
  which described in the original paper <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.08008.pdf>.
  For details see repository <https://github.com/ildoonet/tf-pose-estimation>.
