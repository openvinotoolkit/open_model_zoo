    The "ssd-resnet-34-1200-onnx" model is a multiscale SSD based on ResNet-34
    backbone network intended to perform object detection. The model has been
    trained from the Common Objects in Context (COCO) image dataset. This model
    is pretrained in PyTorch* framework and converted to ONNX* format. For
    additional information refer to repository <https://github.com/mlperf/inference/tree/master/vision/classification_and_detection>.
