  The "ssd-resnet-34-1200-onnx" model is a multiscale SSD based on ResNet-34 backbone
  network intended to perform object detection. The model has been trained from the
  Common Objects in Context (COCO) image dataset. This model is pre-trained in PyTorch*
  framework and converted to ONNX* format. For additional information refer to repository
  <https://github.com/mlcommons/inference/tree/master/vision/classification_and_detection>.
