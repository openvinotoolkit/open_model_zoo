  The "cascade-RCNN" model is two-stage multibox Detection network intended to perform 
  object detection. This model is implemented using mmdetection framework.

  The model input is a blob that consists of a single image of 1x3x800x1333 in BGR
  order. The BGR mean values need to be subtracted
  as follows: [123.675, 116.28, 103.53] before passing the image blob into the network. 
  Also BGR values need to be scaled by division on following coefficients: [58.395, 57.12, 57.375]  

  The model output is a typical vector containing the tracked object data, as previously
  described.
