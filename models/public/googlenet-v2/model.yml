  The "googlenet-v2" model is the second of the Inception <https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07261>
  family of models designed to perform image classification. Like the other Inception
  models, the "googlenet-v2" model has been pre-trained on the ImageNet image database.
  For details about this family of models, check out the paper.

  The model input is a blob that consists of a single image of "1, 3, 224, 224" in
  "BGR" order. The BGR mean values need to be subtracted as follows: [104.0, 117.0,
  123.0] before passing the image blob into the network.

  The model output for "googlenet-v2" is the typical object classifier output for
  the 1000 different classifications matching those in the ImageNet database.
