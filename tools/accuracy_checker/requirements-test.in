# pytest depends on atomicwrites, but only on Windows.
# This means that if we use pip-compile on Linux, the resulting requirements.txt
# will not include atomicwrites and thus will not work on Windows.
# And we _can't_ use pip-compile on Windows, because sentencepiece does not have
# Python 3.5 Windows wheels on PyPI.
# So as a workaround, make the atomicwrites dependency unconditional.
