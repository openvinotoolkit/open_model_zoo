# Preprocessors

Preprocessor is function which processes input data before model inference.
Every preprocessor has parameters available for configuration.
Accuracy Checker supports following set of preprocessors:

* `resize` - resizing the image to a new width and height.
  * `dst_width` and `dst_height` are destination width and height for image resizing respectively.
    You can also use `size` instead in case when destination sizes are equal for both dimensions.
  * `resize_realization` - parameter specifies functionality of which library will be used for resize: `opencv`, `pillow` or `tf` (default `opencv` is used). For enabling `tf` you need to install TensorFlow first.
  For compatibility with previous releases you can also use boolean constants for selection resizing backend:
    * `use_pillow` parameter specifies usage of Pillow library for resizing.
    * `use_tensorflow` parameter specifies usage of TensorFlow Image for resizing. Requires TensorFlow installation.
    Accuracy Checker uses OpenCV as default image reader.
  * `interpolation` specifies method that will be used.
    Possible values depend on image processing library:
      * **OpenCV**: Nearest, Linear, Cubic, Area, Max, Lanczos4, Bits, Bits32
      * **Pillow**: None, Nearest, Cubic, Bicubic, Box, Bilinear, Lanczos, Antialias, Hamming, Linear
      * **TensorFlow**: Bilinear, Area, Bicubic
      `Linear` used as default for OpenCV, `Bilinear` as default for Pillow and TensorFlow.
  * `aspect_ratio_scale` allows resize with changing or saving image aspect ratio. May be done using one of these ways:
    - `width` - rescale width (height has fixed size, provided as `dst_height` or `size`, width size will be rescaled to save aspect ratio).
    - `height` - rescale height (width has fixed size, provided as `dst_width` or `size`, height size will be rescales to save aspect ratio).
    - `greater` - rescale greater from image sizes (smaller dimension has fixed size, greater will be rescaled to save aspect ratio)
    - `fit_to_window` - adaptive resize keeping aspect ratio for fit image into window with fixed size `[dst_height x dst_width]`,
         but trying to make the image as big as possible.
    - `frcnn_keep_aspect_ratio` - adaptive resize keeping aspect ratio for fit image into window with fixed size `[max_size x max_size]`,
         but trying to make the minimal dimension of image to be equal to `min_size` or as close to `min_size` as possible, where
         `min_size = min(dst_width, dst_height)`,
         `max_size = max(dst_width, dst_height)`.
    - `ctpn_keep_aspect_ratio` - adaptive resize keeping aspect ratio for fit image into window with fixed size `[max_size x min_size]` using this algorithm:
      1. Try to resize min original image size to minimal destination size.
      2. If scaled max size greater than maximal destination size, rescale minimal size to get max size equal to max destination size.
    - `east_keep_aspect_ratio` - adaptive resize keeping aspect ratio using this algorithm:
      1. If max image size greater max destination size, make max image size equal to max destination size.
      2. Make image height and width divisible by min destination size without remainder.
    - `min_ratio` - rescale width and height according to minimal ratio `source_size / destination_size`.
    - `mask_rcnn_benchmark_aspect_ratio` - rescale image size according [preprocessing](https://github.com/onnx/models/blob/master/vision/object_detection_segmentation/mask-rcnn/README.md#preprocessing-steps) for maskrcnn-benchmark models in ONNX zoo
  * `factor` -  destination size for aspect ratio resize must be divisible by a given number without remainder.
  Please pay attention that this parameter only works with `aspect_ratio_scale` parameters.
* `auto_resize` - automatic resizing image to input layer shape. (supported only for one input layer case, use OpenCV for image resize)
* `normalization` - changing the range of pixel intensity values.
  * `mean` values which will be subtracted from image channels.
     You can specify one value for all channels or list of comma separated channel-wise values.
  * `std` specifies values, on which pixels will be divided.
     You can specify one value for all channels or list of comma separated channel-wise values.

## Optimized preprocessing via OpenVINO Inference Engine
OpenVINO™ is able perform preprocessing during model execution. For enabling this behaviour you can use command line parameter `--ie_preprocessing True`.
When this option turn on, specified in config preprocessing will be translated to Inference Engine PreProcessInfo API.
**Note**: This option is available only for `dlsdk` launcher and not all preprocessing operations can be ported to Inference Engine.
Supported preprocessing:
* Resizing: `resize` without aspect_ratio_scale and with `BILINEAR` or `AREA` interpolation. Destination size is model input shape. (`auto_resize` is also can be used for resize with bilinear interpolation.)
* Color conversion: `bgr_to_rgb`, `rgb_to_bgr`, `nv12_to_bgr`, `nv12_to_rgb`
* Normalization:  `normalization` with per channel `mean` and `std`
