      The `densenet-121` model is one of the DenseNet <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.06993>
      group of models designed to perform image classification. Originally trained
      on Torch, the authors converted them into Caffe\* format. All the DenseNet models
      have been pretrained on the ImageNet image database. For details about this
      family of models, check out the repository <https://github.com/shicai/DenseNet-Caffe>.

      The model input is a blob that consists of a single image of 1x3x224x224 in
      BGR order. The BGR mean values need to be subtracted as follows: [103.94, 116.78,
      123.68] before passing the image blob into the network. In addition, values
      must be divided by 0.017.

      The model output for `densenet-121` is the typical object classifier output
      for the 1000 different classifications matching those in the ImageNet database.

      The `mtcnn-o` model is the third of the mtcnn <https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1604/1604.02878.pdf>
      group of models designed to perform face detection. Short for "Multi-task Cascaded
      Convolutional Neural Network", it is implemented using the Caffe\* framework.
      The "o" designation indicates that this model is the "output" network intended
      to take the data returned from the "refine" `mtcnn-r` network, and transform
      it into the final output data.  For details about this family of models, check
      out the repository <https://github.com/DuinoDu/mtcnn>.

      The model input is a blob with a vector containing the refined face data, as
      returned by the `mtcnn-r` model. The mean values need to be subtracted as follows:
      [127.5, 127.5, 127.5] before passing the image blob into the network. In addition,
      values must be divided by 0.0078125.

      The model output is a blob with a vector containing the output face data.

      framework. For details about this model, check out the repository <https://github.com/chuanqi305/MobileNet-SSD>.

      The model input is a blob that consists of a single image of 1x3x300x300 in
      BGR order, also like the `densenet-121` model. The BGR mean values need to be
      subtracted as follows: [127.5, 127.5, 127.5] before passing the image blob into
      the network. In addition, values must be divided by 0.007843.

      The `googlenet-v4` model is the most recent of the Inception <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.07261.pdf>
      family of models designed to perform image classification. Like the other Inception
      models, the `googlenet-v4` model has been pretrained on the ImageNet image database.
      For details about this family of models, check out the paper.

      The model input is a blob that consists of a single image of 1x3x299x299 in
      BGR order. The BGR mean values need to be subtracted as follows: [128.0,128.0,128.0]
      before passing the image blob into the network. In addition, values must be
      divided by 0.0078125.

      The model output for `googlenet-v4` is the typical object classifier output
      for the 1000 different classifications matching those in the ImageNet database.

      The `alexnet` model is designed to perform image classification. Just like other
      common classification models, the `alexnet` model has been pretrained on the
      ImageNet image database. For details about this model, check out the paper <http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf>.

      The model input is a blob that consists of a single image of 1x3x227x227 in
      BGR order. The BGR mean values need to be subtracted as follows: [104, 117,
      123] before passing the image blob into the network.

      The model output for `alexnet` is the usual object classifier output for the
      1000 different classifications matching those in the ImageNet database.

    description: >-
      The `ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco` model is a Single-Shot multibox Detection <SSD>
      <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.04381.pdf> network intended to perform object detection.
      The difference between this model and the `mobilenet-ssd` is that the while
      `mobilenet-ssd` detects faces only, the `ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco` model detects
      objects, as it has been trained from the Common Objects in Context (COCO) image
      dataset.

      The model input is a blob that consists of a single image of 1x3x300x300 in
      RGB order.

      The model output is a typical vector containing the tracked object data, as
      previously described. Note that the "class_id" data is now significant and should
      be used to determine the classification for any detected object.

      This model was created for participation in the Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge
      <https://www.med.upenn.edu/sbia/brats2018.html> (BraTS) 2018.   The model is
      based on the corresponding paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04008>, where authors
      present deep cascaded approach for automatic brain tumor segmentation. The paper
      describes modifications to 3D UNet architecture and specific augmentation strategy
      to efficiently handle multimodal MRI input. Besides this, the approach to enhance
      segmentation quality with context obtained from models of the same topology
      operating on downscaled data is introduced.   Each input modality has its own
      encoder which are later fused together to produce single output segmentation.

      dataset specification to see list of action that are recognised by this model.

      This model is only decoder part of the whole pipeline. It accepts stack of frame
      embeddings, computed by action-recognition-0001-encoder, and produces prediction
      on input video. Video frames should be sampled to cover ~1 second fragment (i.e.
      skip every second frame in 30 fps video).

    description: >-
      This is a lightweight network for the face re-identification scenario. It is
      based on MobileNet V2 backbone, which consists of 3x3 inverted residual blocks
      with squeeze-excitation attention modules. Instead of the ReLU6 activations
      used in the original MobileNet V2, this network uses PReLU ones. After the backbone,
      the network applies global depthwise pooling and then uses 1x1 convolution to
      create the final embedding vector. The model produces feature vectors which
      should be close in cosine distance for similar faces and far for different faces.

      This is the Inception v3 model that is designed to perform image classification.
      The model has been pretrained on the ImageNet image database and then pruned
      to **30.9%** of sparsity and quantized to INT8 fixed-point precision using
      so-called Quantization-aware training approach implemented in TensorFlow framework.
      The sparsity is represented by zeros inside the weights of Convolutional and
      Fully-conneted layers. For details about the original floating point model,
      check out the paper <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf>.

      The model input is a blob that consists of a single image of "1x299x299x3"
      in BGR order.

      The model output for `inceptionv3-int8-sparse-v1-tf-0001` is the usual object
      classifier output for the 1001 different classifications matching those in
      the ImageNet database (the first item represents the background).

      This is a lightweight landmarks regressor for the Smart Classroom scenario.
      It has a classic convolutional design: stacked 3x3 convolutions, batch normalizations,
      PReLU activations, and poolings. Final regression is done by the global depthwise
      pooling head and FullyConnected layers. The model predicts five facial landmarks:
      two eyes, nose, and two lip corners.

      This is an action detector for the Smart Classroom scenario. It is based on
      the RMNet backbone that includes depth-wise convolutions to reduce the amount
      of computations for the 3x3 convolution block. The first SSD head from 1/16
      scale feature map has four clustered prior boxes and outputs detected persons
      (two class detector). The second SSD-based head predicts actions of the detected
      persons. Possible actions: sitting, standing, raising hand.

      This is a classical classification network for 1000 classes trained on ImageNet.
      The difference is that most convolutional layers were replaced by binary once
      that can be implemented as XNOR+POPCOUN operations. Only input, final and shortcut
      layers were kept as FP32, all the rest convolutional layers are replaced by
      BinaryConvolution layers.
