# Model Downloader and other automation tools

This directory contains scripts that automate certain model-related tasks
based on configuration files in the models' directories.

* `downloader.py` (model downloader) downloads model files from online sources
  and, if necessary, patches them to make them more usable with Model
  Optimizer;

* `converter.py` (model converter) converts the models that are not in the
  Inference Engine IR format into that format using Model Optimizer.

* `quantizer.py` (model quantizer) quantizes full-precision models in the IR
  format into low-precision versions using Post-Training Optimization Toolkit.

* `info_dumper.py` (model information dumper) prints information about the models
  in a stable machine-readable format.

Please use these tools instead of attempting to parse the configuration files
directly. Their format is undocumented and may change in incompatible ways in
future releases.

> **TIP**: You also can work with the Model Downloader inside the OpenVINO™ [Deep Learning Workbench](@ref workbench_docs_Workbench_DG_Introduction) (DL Workbench).
> [DL Workbench](@ref workbench_docs_Workbench_DG_Introduction) is a platform built upon OpenVINO™ and provides a web-based graphical environment that enables you to optimize, fine-tune, analyze, visualize, and compare
> performance of deep learning models on various Intel® architecture
> configurations. In the DL Workbench, you can use most of OpenVINO™ toolkit components.

> Proceed to an [easy installation from Docker](@ref workbench_docs_Workbench_DG_Install_from_Docker_Hub) to get started.

## Prerequisites

1. Install Python (version 3.6 or higher)
2. Install the tools' dependencies with the following command:

```sh
python3 -mpip install --user -r ./requirements.in
```

For the model converter, you will also need to install the OpenVINO&trade;
toolkit and the prerequisite libraries for Model Optimizer. See the
[OpenVINO toolkit documentation](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/) for details.

To convert models from certain frameworks, you will also need to install
additional dependencies.

For models from Caffe2:

```sh
python3 -mpip install --user -r ./requirements-caffe2.in
```

For models from PyTorch:

```sh
python3 -mpip install --user -r ./requirements-pytorch.in
```

For models from TensorFlow:

```sh
python3 -mpip install --user -r ./requirements-tensorflow.in
```

## Model downloader usage

The basic usage is to run the script like this:

```sh
./downloader.py --all
```

This will download all models. The `--all` option can be replaced with
other filter options to download only a subset of models. See the "Shared options"
section.

By default, the script will download models into a directory tree rooted
in the current directory. To download into a different directory, use
the `-o`/`--output_dir` option:

```sh
./downloader.py --all --output_dir my/download/directory
```

You may use `--precisions` flag to specify comma separated precisions of weights
to be downloaded.

```sh
./downloader.py --name face-detection-retail-0004 --precisions FP16,FP16-INT8
```

By default, the script will attempt to download each file only once. You can use
the `--num_attempts` option to change that and increase the robustness of the
download process:

```sh
./downloader.py --all --num_attempts 5 # attempt each download five times
```

You can use the `--cache_dir` option to make the script use the specified directory
as a cache. The script will place a copy of each downloaded file in the cache, or,
if it is already there, retrieve it from the cache instead of downloading it again.

```sh
./downloader.py --all --cache_dir my/cache/directory
```

The cache format is intended to remain compatible in future Open Model Zoo
versions, so you can use a cache to avoid redownloading most files when updating
Open Model Zoo.

By default, the script outputs progress information as unstructured, human-readable
text. If you want to consume progress information programmatically, use the
`--progress_format` option:

```sh
./downloader.py --all --progress_format=json
```

When this option is set to `json`, the script's standard output is replaced by
a machine-readable progress report, whose format is documented in the
"JSON progress report format" section. This option does not affect errors and
warnings, which will still be printed to the standard error stream in a
human-readable format.

You can also set this option to `text` to explicitly request the default text
format.

The script can download files for multiple models concurrently. To enable this,
use the `-j`/`--jobs` option:

```sh
./downloader.py --all -j8 # download up to 8 models at a time
```

See the "Shared options" section for information on other options accepted by
the script.

### JSON progress report format

This section documents the format of the progress report produced by the script
when the `--progress_format=json` option is specified.

The report consists of a sequence of events, where each event is represented
by a line containing a JSON-encoded object. Each event has a member with the
name `$type` whose value determines the type of the event, as well as which
additional members it contains.

The following event types are currently defined:

* `model_download_begin`

  Additional members: `model` (string), `num_files` (integer).

  The script started downloading the model named by `model`.
  `num_files` is the number of files that will be downloaded for this model.

  This event will always be followed by a corresponding `model_download_end` event.

* `model_download_end`

  Additional members: `model` (string), `successful` (boolean).

  The script stopped downloading the model named by `model`.
  `successful` is true if every file was downloaded successfully.

* `model_file_download_begin`

  Additional members: `model` (string), `model_file` (string), `size` (integer).

  The script started downloading the file named by `model_file` of the model named
  by `model`. `size` is the size of the file in bytes.

  This event will always occur between `model_download_begin` and `model_download_end`
  events for the model, and will always be followed by a corresponding
  `model_file_download_end` event.

* `model_file_download_end`

  Additional members: `model` (string), `model_file` (string), `successful` (boolean).

  The script stopped downloading the file named by `model_file` of the model named
  by `model`. `successful` is true if the file was downloaded successfully.

* `model_file_download_progress`

  Additional members: `model` (string), `model_file` (string), `size` (integer).

  The script downloaded `size` bytes of the file named by `model_file` of
  the model named by `model` so far. Note that `size` can decrease in a subsequent
  event if the download is interrupted and retried.

  This event will always occur between `model_file_download_begin` and
  `model_file_download_end` events for the file.

* `model_postprocessing_begin`

  Additional members: `model`.

  The script started post-download processing on the model named by `model`.

  This event will always be followed by a corresponding `model_postprocessing_end` event.

* `model_postprocessing_end`

  Additional members: `model`.

  The script stopped post-download processing on the model named by `model`.

Additional event types and members may be added in the future.

Tools parsing the machine-readable format should avoid relying on undocumented details.
In particular:

* Tools should not assume that any given event will occur for a given model/file
  (unless specified otherwise above) or will only occur once.

* Tools should not assume that events will occur in a certain order beyond
  the ordering constraints specified above. In particular, when the `--jobs` option
  is set to a value greater than 1, event sequences for different files or models
  may get interleaved.

## Model converter usage

The basic usage is to run the script like this:

```sh
./converter.py --all
```

This will convert all models into the Inference Engine IR format. Models that
were originally in that format are ignored. Models in PyTorch and Caffe2 formats will be
converted in ONNX format first.

The `--all` option can be replaced with other filter options to convert only
a subset of models. See the "Shared options" section.

The current directory must be the root of a download tree created by the model
downloader. To specify a different download tree path, use the `-d`/`--download_dir`
option:

```sh
./converter.py --all --download_dir my/download/directory
```

By default, the converted models are placed into the download tree. To place them
into a different directory tree, use the `-o`/`--output_dir` option:

```sh
./converter.py --all --output_dir my/output/directory
```
>Note: models in intermediate format are placed to this directory too.

By default, the script will produce models in every precision that is supported
for conversion. To only produce models in a specific precision, use the `--precisions`
option:

```sh
./converter.py --all --precisions=FP16
```

If the specified precision is not supported for a model, that model will be skipped.

By default, the script will run Model Optimizer using the same Python executable
that was used to run the script itself. To use a different Python executable,
use the `-p`/`--python` option:

```sh
./converter.py --all --python my/python
```

The script will attempt to locate Model Optimizer using several methods:

1. If the `--mo` option was specified, then its value will be used as the path
   to the script to run:

   ```sh
   ./converter.py --all --mo my/openvino/path/model_optimizer/mo.py
   ```

2. Otherwise, if the selected Python executable can import the `mo` package,
   then that package will be used.

3. Otherwise, if the OpenVINO&trade; toolkit's `setupvars.sh`/`setupvars.bat`
   script has been executed, the environment variables set by that script will
   be used to locate Model Optimizer within the toolkit.

4. Otherwise, the script will fail.

You can add extra Model Optimizer arguments to the ones specified in the model
configuration by using the `--add_mo_arg` option. The option can be repeated
to add multiple arguments:

```sh
./converter.py --name=caffenet --add_mo_arg=--reverse_input_channels --add_mo_arg=--silent
```

The script can run multiple conversion commands concurrently. To enable this,
use the `-j`/`--jobs` option:

```sh
./converter.py --all -j8 # run up to 8 commands at a time
```

The argument to the option must be either a maximum number of concurrently
executed commands, or "auto", in which case the number of CPUs in the system is used.
By default, all commands are run sequentially.

The script can print the conversion commands without actually running them.
To do this, use the `--dry_run` option:

```sh
./converter.py --all --dry_run
```

See the "Shared options" section for information on other options accepted by
the script.

## Model Quantizer Usage

Before you run the model quantizer, you must prepare a directory with
the datasets required for the quantization process. This directory will be
referred to as `<DATASET_DIR>` below. You can find more detailed information
about dataset preparation in the [Dataset Preparation Guide](../../data/datasets.md).

The basic usage is to run the script like this:

```sh
./quantizer.py --all --dataset_dir <DATASET_DIR>
```

This will quantize all models for which quantization is supported. Other models
are ignored.

The `--all` option can be replaced with other filter options to quantize only
a subset of models. See the "Shared options" section.

The current directory must be the root of a tree of model files create by the model
converter. To specify a different model tree path, use the `--model_dir` option:

```sh
./quantizer.py --all --dataset_dir <DATASET_DIR> --model_dir my/model/directory
```

By default, the quantized models are placed into the same model tree. To place them
into a different directory tree, use the `-o`/`--output_dir` option:

```sh
./quantizer.py --all --dataset_dir <DATASET_DIR> --output_dir my/output/directory
```

By default, the script will produce models in every precision that is supported
as a quantization output. To only produce models in a specific precision, use
the `--precisions` option:

```sh
./quantizer.py --all --dataset_dir <DATASET_DIR> --precisions=FP16-INT8
```

By default, the script will run Post-Training Optimization Toolkit using the same
Python executable that was used to run the script itself. To use a different
Python executable, use the `-p`/`--python` option:

```sh
./quantizer.py --all --dataset_dir <DATASET_DIR> --python my/python
```

The script will attempt to locate Post-Training Optimization Toolkit using several methods:

1. If the `--pot` option was specified, then its value will be used as the path
   to the script to run:

   ```sh
   ./quantizer.py --all --dataset_dir <DATASET_DIR> --pot my/openvino/path/post_training_optimization_toolkit/main.py
   ```

2. Otherwise, if the selected Python executable can import the `pot` package,
   then that package will be used.

3. Otherwise, if the OpenVINO&trade; toolkit's `setupvars.sh`/`setupvars.bat`
   script has been executed, the environment variables set by that script will
   be used to locate Post-Training Optimization Toolkit within the OpenVINO toolkit.

4. Otherwise, the script will fail.

It's possible to specify a target device for Post-Training Optimization Toolkit
to optimize for, by using the `--target_device` option:

```sh
./quantizer.py --all --dataset_dir <DATASET_DIR> --target_device VPU
```

The supported values are those accepted by the "target_device" option in
Post-Training Optimization Toolkit's config files. If this option is unspecified,
Post-Training Optimization Toolkit's default is used.

The script can print the quantization commands without actually running them.
To do this, use the `--dry_run` option:

```sh
./quantizer.py --all --dataset_dir <DATASET_DIR> --dry_run
```

With this option specified, the configuration file for Post-Training Optimization
Toolkit will still be created, so that you can inspect it.

See the "Shared options" section for information on other options accepted by
the script.

## Model information dumper usage

The basic usage is to run the script like this:

```sh
./info_dumper.py --all
```

This will print to standard output information about all models.

The only options accepted by the script are those described in the "Shared options"
section.

The script's output is a JSON array, each element of which is a JSON object
describing a single model. Each such object has the following keys:

* `name`: the identifier of the model, as accepted by the `--name` option.

* `description`: text describing the model. Paragraphs are separated by line feed characters.

* `framework`: a string identifying the framework whose format the model is downloaded in.
  Current possible values are `dldt` (Inference Engine IR), `caffe`, `caffe2`, `mxnet`, `onnx`,
  `pytorch` and `tf` (TensorFlow). Additional possible values might be added in the future.

* `license_url`: an URL for the license that the model is distributed under.

* `precisions`: the list of precisions that the model has IR files for. For models downloaded
  in a format other than the Inference Engine IR format, these are the precisions that the model
  converter can produce IR files in. Current possible values are:

  * `FP16`
  * `FP16-INT1`
  * `FP16-INT8`
  * `FP32`
  * `FP32-INT1`
  * `FP32-INT8`

  Additional possible values might be added in the future.

* `quantization_output_precisions`: the list of precisions that the model can be quantized to by
  the model quantizer. Current possible values are `FP16-INT8` and `FP32-INT8`; additional
  possible values might be added in the future.

* `subdirectory`: the subdirectory of the output tree into which the downloaded or converted files
  will be placed by the downloader or the converter, respectively.

* `task_type`: a string identifying the type of task that the model performs. Current possible values
  are:

  * `action_recognition`
  * `classification`
  * `colorization`
  * `detection`
  * `face_recognition`
  * `feature_extraction`
  * `head_pose_estimation`
  * `human_pose_estimation`
  * `image_inpainting`
  * `image_processing`
  * `image_translation`
  * `instance_segmentation`
  * `machine_translation`
  * `monocular_depth_estimation`
  * `named_entity_recognition`
  * `object_attributes`
  * `optical_character_recognition`
  * `place_recognition`
  * `question_answering`
  * `salient_object_detection`
  * `semantic_segmentation`
  * `sound_classification`
  * `speech_recognition`
  * `style_transfer`
  * `token_recognition`
  * `text_to_speech`

  Additional possible values might be added in the future.

## Shared options

The are certain options that all tools accept.

`-h`/`--help` can be used to print a help message:

```sh
./TOOL.py --help
```

There are several mutually exclusive filter options that select the models the
tool will process:

* `--all` selects all models.

  ```sh
  ./TOOL.py --all
  ```

* `--name` takes a comma-separated list of patterns and selects models that match
  at least one of these patterns. The patterns may contain shell-style wildcards.

  ```sh
  ./TOOL.py --name 'mtcnn-p,densenet-*'
  ```

  See https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html for a full description of
  the pattern syntax.

* `--list` takes a path to a file that must contain a list of patterns and
  selects models that match at least one of those patterns.

  ```sh
  ./TOOL.py --list my.lst
  ```

  The file must contain one pattern per line. The pattern syntax is the same
  as for the `--name` option. Blank lines and comments starting with `#` are
  ignored. For example:

  ```
  mtcnn-p
  densenet-* # get all DenseNet variants
  ```

To see the available models, you can use the `--print_all` option. When this
option is specified, the tool will print all model names defined in the
configuration file and exit:

```
$ ./TOOL.py --print_all
action-recognition-0001-decoder
action-recognition-0001-encoder
age-gender-recognition-retail-0013
driver-action-recognition-adas-0002-decoder
driver-action-recognition-adas-0002-encoder
emotions-recognition-retail-0003
face-detection-adas-0001
face-detection-retail-0004
face-detection-retail-0005
[...]
```

Either `--print_all` or one of the filter options must be specified.
