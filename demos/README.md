Open Model Zoo demos are console applications that provide templates to help implement specific deep learning inference scenarios. These applications show how to preprocess and postrpocess data for model inference and organize processing pipelines. Some pipelines collect analysis data from several models being inferred simultaneously. For example, [detecting a person in a video stream along with detecting the person's physical attributes, such as age, gender, and emotional state](./interactive_face_detection_demo/cpp/README.md).

Source code of the demos can be obtained from the Open Model Zoo [GitHub repository](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo/).

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo.git

## Media Files Available for Demos

To run the demo applications, you can use videos from https://storage.openvinotoolkit.org/data/test_data/videos.

## Demos that Support Pre-Trained Models

You can download the [Intel pre-trained models](../models/intel/index.md) or [public pre-trained models](../models/public/index.md) using the OpenVINO [Model Downloader](../tools/model_tools/README.md).

## Build the Demo Applications

To build the demos, you need to source OpenVINO™ environment and [get OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/BuildOpenCV4OpenVINO). You can install the OpenVINO™ toolkit using the installation package for [Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/openvino-toolkit-download.html) or build the open-source version available in the [OpenVINO GitHub repository](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino) using the [build instructions](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/wiki/BuildingCode).
For the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit installed to the `<INSTALL_DIR>` directory on your machine, run the following commands to download prebuilt OpenCV and set environment variables before building the demos:

```sh
source <INSTALL_DIR>/setupvars.sh
```

> **NOTE:** If you plan to use Python\* demos only, you can install the OpenVINO Python\* package.
> ```sh
> pip install openvino
> ```

For the open-source version of OpenVINO, set the following variables:
* `OpenVINO_DIR` pointing to a folder containing `OpenVINOConfig.cmake`
* `OpenCV_DIR` pointing to OpenCV. The same OpenCV version should be used both for OpenVINO and demos build.

Alternatively, these values can be provided via command line while running `cmake`. See [CMake search procedure](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/find_package.html#search-procedure).
Also add paths to the built OpenVINO™ Runtime libraries to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (Linux) or `PATH` (Windows) variable before building the demos.

### <a name="build_demos_linux"></a>Build the Demo Applications on Linux*

The officially supported Linux* build environment is the following:

- Ubuntu* 18.04 LTS 64-bit or Ubuntu* 20.04 LTS 64-bit
- GCC* 7.5.0 (for Ubuntu* 18.04) or GCC* 9.3.0 (for Ubuntu* 20.04)
- CMake* version 3.10 or higher.

To build the demo applications for Linux, go to the directory with the `build_demos.sh` script and
run it:

```sh
build_demos.sh
```

You can also build the demo applications manually:

1. Navigate to a directory that you have write access to and create a demos build directory. This example uses a directory named `build`:
```sh
mkdir build
```
2. Go to the created directory:
```sh
cd build
```

3. Run CMake to generate the Make files for release or debug configuration:
  - For release configuration:
  ```sh
  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release <open_model_zoo>/demos
  ```
  - For debug configuration:
  ```sh
  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug <open_model_zoo>/demos
  ```
4. Run `cmake --build` tool to build the demos:
```sh
cmake --build .
```

For the release configuration, the demo application binaries are in `<path_to_build_directory>/intel64/Release/`;
for the debug configuration — in `<path_to_build_directory>/intel64/Debug/`.

### <a name="build_demos_windows"></a>Build the Demos Applications on Microsoft Windows* OS

The recommended Windows* build environment is the following:

- Microsoft Windows* 10
- Microsoft Visual Studio* 2019
- CMake* version 3.14 or higher

To build the demo applications for Windows, go to the directory with the `build_demos_msvc.bat`
batch file and run it:

```bat
build_demos_msvc.bat
```

By default, the script automatically detects the highest Microsoft Visual Studio version installed on the machine and uses it to create and build
a solution for a demo code. Optionally, you can also specify the preferred Microsoft Visual Studio version to be used by the script. Supported
version is: `VS2019`. For example, to build the demos using the Microsoft Visual Studio 2019, use the following command:

```bat
build_demos_msvc.bat VS2019
```

By default, the demo applications binaries are build into the `C:\Users\<username>\Documents\Intel\OpenVINO\omz_demos_build\intel64\Release` directory.
The default build folder can be changed with `-b` option. For example, following command will build Open Model Zoo demos into `c:\temp\omz-demos-build` folder:

```bat
build_demos_msvc.bat -b c:\temp\omz-demos-build
```


You can also build a generated solution by yourself, for example, if you want to
build binaries in Debug configuration. Run the appropriate version of the
Microsoft Visual Studio and open the generated solution file from the `C:\Users\<username>\Documents\Intel\OpenVINO\omz_demos_build\Demos.sln`
directory.

You can also build the demo applications using `cmake --build` tool:
1. Navigate to a directory that you have write access to and create a demos build directory. This example uses a directory named `build`:
```
md build
```
2. Go to the created directory:
```
cd build
```
3. Run CMake to generate project files:
```
cmake -A x64 <open_model_zoo>/demos
```
4. Run `cmake --build` tool to  build the demos:
  - For release configuration
  ```
  cmake --build . --config Release
  ```
  - For debug configuration:
  ```
  cmake --build . --config Debug
  ```

### <a name="python_requirements"></a>Dependencies for Python* Demos

The dependencies for Python demos must be installed before running. It can be achieved with the following command:

```sh
python -mpip install --user -r <omz_dir>/demos/requirements.txt
```

### <a name="python_model_api"></a>Python\* model API package

Python* ModelAPI is factored out as a sepparate package. Refer to the [Python Model API documentation](common/python/openvino/model_zoo/model_api/README.md#installing-python-model-api-package) to learn about its installation. At the same time demos can find this package on their own. It's not required to install ModelAPI for demos.

### <a name="build_python_extensions"></a>Build the Native Python\* Extension Modules

Some of the Python demo applications require native Python extension modules to be built before they can be run.
This requires you to have Python development files (headers and import libraries) installed.
To build these modules, follow the instructions for building the demo applications above,
but add `-DENABLE_PYTHON=ON` to either the `cmake` or the `build_demos*` command, depending on which you use.
For example:

```sh
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DENABLE_PYTHON=ON <open_model_zoo>/demos
```

Once the modules are built, add the demo build folder to the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable.

### <a name="build_specific_demos"></a>Build Specific Demos

To build specific demos, follow the instructions for building the demo applications above,
but add `--target <demo1> <demo2> ...` to the `cmake --build` command or `--target="<demo1> <demo2> ..."` to the `build_demos*` command.
Note, `cmake --build` tool supports multiple targets starting with version 3.15, with lower versions you can specify only one target.

For Linux*:
```sh
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release <open_model_zoo>/demos
cmake --build . --target classification_demo segmentation_demo
```
or
```sh
build_demos.sh --target="classification_demo segmentation_demo"
```
For Microsoft Windows* OS:

```
cmake -A x64 <open_model_zoo>/demos
cmake --build . --config Release --target classification_demo segmentation_demo
```
or

```bat
build_demos_msvc.bat --target="classification_demo segmentation_demo"
```

## Get Ready for Running the Demo Applications

### Get Ready for Running the Demo Applications on Linux*

Before running compiled binary files, make sure your application can find the OpenVINO™ and OpenCV libraries.
If you use a [proprietary](https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit) distribution to build demos,
run the `setupvars` script to set all necessary environment variables:

```sh
source <INSTALL_DIR>/setupvars.sh
```

If you use your own OpenVINO™ and OpenCV binaries to build the demos please make sure you have added them
to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable.

**(Optional)**: The OpenVINO environment variables are removed when you close the
shell. As an option, you can permanently set the environment variables as follows:

1. Open the `.bashrc` file in `<user_home_directory>`:

```sh
vi <user_home_directory>/.bashrc
```

2. Add this line to the end of the file:

```sh
source <INSTALL_DIR>/setupvars.sh
```

3. Save and close the file: press the **Esc** key, type `:wq` and press the **Enter** key.
4. To test your change, open a new terminal. You will see `[setupvars.sh] OpenVINO environment initialized`.

To run Python demo applications that require native Python extension modules, you must additionally
set up the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable as follows, where `<bin_dir>` is the directory with
the built demo applications:

```sh
export PYTHONPATH="<bin_dir>:$PYTHONPATH"
```

You are ready to run the demo applications. To learn about how to run a particular
demo, read the demo documentation by clicking the demo name in the demo
list above.

### Get Ready for Running the Demo Applications on Windows*

Before running compiled binary files, make sure your application can find the OpenVINO™ and OpenCV libraries.
Optionally, download the OpenCV community FFmpeg plugin using the downloader script in the OpenVINO package: `<INSTALL_DIR>\extras\opencv\ffmpeg-download.ps1`.
If you use the [Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/openvino-toolkit/overview.html) distribution to build demos,
run the `setupvars` script to set all necessary environment variables:

```bat
<INSTALL_DIR>\setupvars.bat
```

If you use your own OpenVINO™ and OpenCV binaries to build the demos please make sure you have added
to the `PATH` environment variable.

To run Python demo applications that require native Python extension modules, you must additionally
set up the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable as follows, where `<bin_dir>` is the directory with
the built demo applications:

```bat
set PYTHONPATH=<bin_dir>;%PYTHONPATH%
```

To debug or run the demos on Windows in Microsoft Visual Studio, make sure you
have properly configured **Debugging** environment settings for the **Debug**
and **Release** configurations. Set correct paths to the OpenCV libraries, and
debug and release versions of the OpenVINO™ libraries.
For example, for the **Debug** configuration, go to the project's
**Configuration Properties** to the **Debugging** category and set the `PATH`
variable in the **Environment** field to the following:

```
PATH=<INSTALL_DIR>\runtime\bin\intel64\Debug;<INSTALL_DIR>\extras\opencv\bin;%PATH%
```

where `<INSTALL_DIR>` is the directory in which the OpenVINO toolkit is installed.

You are ready to run the demo applications. To learn about how to run a particular
demo, read the demo documentation by clicking the demo name in the demos
list above.
