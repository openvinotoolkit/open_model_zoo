# Human Pose Estimation Python\* Demo

![example](../human_pose_estimation.gif)

This demo showcases the work of multi-person 2D pose estimation algorithms. The task is to predict a pose: body skeleton, which consists of a predefined set of keypoints and connections between them, for every person in an input image/video.

## How It Works

On the start-up, the application reads command-line parameters and loads a network to the Inference
Engine. Upon getting a frame from the OpenCV VideoCapture, it performs inference and displays the results.

> **NOTE**: By default, Open Model Zoo demos expect input with BGR channels order. If you trained your model to work
with RGB order, you need to manually rearrange the default channels order in the demo application or reconvert your
model using the Model Optimizer tool with `--reverse_input_channels` argument specified. For more information about
the argument, refer to **When to Reverse Input Channels** section of
[Converting a Model Using General Conversion Parameters](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_docs_MO_DG_prepare_model_convert_model_Converting_Model_General.html).

## Preparing to Run

                                     [-u UTILIZATION_MONITORS] [-r]

Options:
  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit.
  -m MODEL, --model MODEL
                        Required. Path to an .xml file with a trained model.
  -at {ae,higherhrnet,openpose}, --architecture_type {ae,higherhrnet,openpose}
                        Required. Specify model' architecture type.
  -i INPUT, --input INPUT
                        Required. An input to process. The input must be a
                        single image, a folder of images, video file or camera
                        id.
  --loop                Optional. Enable reading the input in a loop.
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Optional. Name of output to save.
  -limit OUTPUT_LIMIT, --output_limit OUTPUT_LIMIT
                        Optional. Number of frames to store in output. If 0 is
                        set, all frames are stored.
  -d DEVICE, --device DEVICE
                        Optional. Specify the target device to infer on; CPU,
                        GPU, FPGA, HDDL or MYRIAD is acceptable. The sample
                        will look for a suitable plugin for device specified.
                        Default value is CPU.

Common model options:
  -t PROB_THRESHOLD, --prob_threshold PROB_THRESHOLD
                        Optional. Probability threshold for poses filtering.
  --tsize TSIZE         Optional. Target input size. This demo implements
                        image pre-processing pipeline that is common to human
                        pose estimation approaches. Image is first resized to
                        some target size and then the network is reshaped to
                        fit the input image shape. By default target image
                        size is determined based on the input shape from IR.
                        Alternatively it can be manually set via this
                        parameter. Note that for OpenPose-like nets image is
                        resized to a predefined height, which is the target
                        size in this case. For Associative Embedding-like nets
                        target size is the length of a short first image side.

Inference options:
  -nireq NUM_INFER_REQUESTS, --num_infer_requests NUM_INFER_REQUESTS
                        Optional. Number of infer requests
  -nstreams NUM_STREAMS, --num_streams NUM_STREAMS
                        Optional. Number of streams to use for inference on
                        the CPU or/and GPU in throughput mode (for HETERO and
                        MULTI device cases use format
                        <device1>:<nstreams1>,<device2>:<nstreams2> or just
                        <nstreams>).
  -nthreads NUM_THREADS, --num_threads NUM_THREADS
                        Optional. Number of threads to use for inference on
                        CPU (including HETERO cases).

Input/output options:
  -no_show, --no_show   Optional. Don't show output.
  --output_resolution OUTPUT_RESOLUTION
                        Optional. Specify the maximum output window resolution
                        in (width x height) format. Example: 1280x720.
                        Input frame used by default.
  -u UTILIZATION_MONITORS, --utilization_monitors UTILIZATION_MONITORS
                        Optional. List of monitors to show initially.

Debug options:
  -r, --raw_output_message
                        Optional. Output inference results raw values showing.
```

Running the application with the empty list of options yields the short usage message and an error message.

You can use the following command to do inference on CPU with a pre-trained human pose estimation model:

```sh
python3 human_pose_estimation.py -i 0 -m human-pose-estimation-0002.xml -at ae -d CPU
```

## Demo Output

The demo uses OpenCV to display the resulting frame with estimated poses.
The demo reports

* **FPS**: average rate of video frame processing (frames per second)
* **Latency**: average time required to process one frame (from reading the frame to displaying the results)
You can use both of these metrics to measure application-level performance.
