# Place Recognition Python\* Demo

This demo demonstrates how to run Place Recognition models using OpenVINO&trade;.

> **NOTE**: Only batch size of 1 is supported.

## How It Works

The demo application expects a place recognition model in the Intermediate Representation (IR) format.

As input, the demo application takes:

* a path to an image
* a path to a folder with images
* a path to a video file or a device node of a webcam

The demo workflow is the following:

1. The demo application reads input frames.
2. Extracted input frame is passed to artificial neural network that computes embedding vector.
3. Then the demo application searches computed embedding in gallery of images in order to determine which image in the gallery is the most similar to what one can see on frame.
4. The app visualizes results of it work as graphical window where following objects are shown.
    - Input frame.
    - Top-10 most similar images from the gallery.
    - Performance characteristics.

> **NOTE**: By default, Open Model Zoo demos expect input with BGR channels order. If you trained your model to work with RGB order, you need to manually rearrange the default channels order in the demo application or reconvert your model using the Model Optimizer tool with `--reverse_input_channels` argument specified. For more information about the argument, refer to **When to Reverse Input Channels** section of [Converting a Model Using General Conversion Parameters](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_docs_MO_DG_prepare_model_convert_model_Converting_Model_General.html).

## Preparing to Run

For demo input image or video files you may refer to [Media Files Available for Demos](../../README.md#Media-Files-Available-for-Demos).
The list of models supported by the demo is in `<omz_dir>/demos/place_recognition_demo/python/models.lst` file.
This file can be used as a parameter for [Model Downloader](../../../tools/downloader/README.md) and Converter to download and, if necessary, convert models to OpenVINO Inference Engine format (\*.xml + \*.bin).

### Supported Models

* netvlad-tf

> **NOTE**: Refer to the tables [Intel's Pre-Trained Models Device Support](../../../models/intel/device_support.md) and [Public Pre-Trained Models Device Support](../../../models/public/device_support.md) for the details on models inference support at different devices.

## Running

Run the application with the `-h` option to see the following usage message:

```
usage: place_recognition_demo.py [-h] -m MODEL -i INPUT -gf GALLERY_FOLDER
                                 [--gallery_size GALLERY_SIZE] [--loop]
                                 [-o OUTPUT] [-limit OUTPUT_LIMIT] [-d DEVICE]
                                 [-l CPU_EXTENSION] [--no_show]
                                 [-u UTILIZATION_MONITORS]

Options:
  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit.
  -m MODEL, --model MODEL
                        Required. Path to an .xml file with a trained model.
  -i INPUT, --input INPUT
                        Required. An input to process. The input must be a
                        single image, a folder of images, video file or camera
                        id.
  -gf GALLERY_FOLDER, --gallery_folder GALLERY_FOLDER
                        Required. Path to a folder with images in the gallery.
  --gallery_size GALLERY_SIZE
                        Optional. Number of images from the gallery used for
                        processing
  --loop                Optional. Enable reading the input in a loop.
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Optional. Name of output to save.
  -limit OUTPUT_LIMIT, --output_limit OUTPUT_LIMIT
                        Optional. Number of frames to store in output. If 0
                        is set, all frames are stored.
  -d DEVICE, --device DEVICE
                        Optional. Specify the target device to infer on: CPU,
                        GPU, FPGA, HDDL or MYRIAD. The demo will look for a
                        suitable plugin for device specified (by default, it
                        is CPU).
  -l CPU_EXTENSION, --cpu_extension CPU_EXTENSION
                        Optional. Required for CPU custom layers. Absolute
                        path to a shared library with the kernels
                        implementations.
  --no_show             Optional. Do not visualize inference results.
  -u UTILIZATION_MONITORS, --utilization_monitors UTILIZATION_MONITORS
                        Optional. List of monitors to show initially.
```

Running the application with an empty list of options yields the short version of the usage message and an error message.

To run the demo, please provide paths to the model in the IR format, to directory with gallery images, and to an input video, image, or folder with images:

```bash
python place_recognition_demo.py \
-m <path_to_model>/netvlad-tf.xml \
-i <path_to_file>/image.jpg \
-gf <path>/gallery_folder
```

## Demo Output

The application uses OpenCV to display gallery searching result and current inference performance.
