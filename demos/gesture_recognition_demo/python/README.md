# Gesture Recognition Python\* Demo

![example](./gesture_recognition.gif)

This demo demonstrates how to run Gesture (e.g. American Sign Language (ASL) gestures) Recognition models using OpenVINO&trade; toolkit.

## How It Works

The demo application expects a gesture recognition model in the Intermediate Representation (IR) format.

As input, the demo application takes:

* a path to a video file or a device node of a webcam specified with a command line argument `--input`
* a path to a file in JSON format with gesture class names `--class_map`

The demo workflow is the following:

1. The demo application reads video frames one by one, runs person detector that extracts ROI, tracks the ROI of very first person. Additional process is used to prepare the batch of frames with constant framerate.
2. Batch of frames and extracted ROI are passed to artificial neural network that predicts the gesture.
3. The app visualizes results of its work as graphical window where following objects are shown:
    - Input frame with detected ROI.
    - Last recognized gesture.
    - Performance characteristics.

> **NOTE**: By default, Open Model Zoo demos expect input with BGR channels order. If you trained your model to work with RGB order, you need to manually rearrange the default channels order in the demo application or reconvert your model using the Model Optimizer tool with the `--reverse_input_channels` argument specified. For more information about the argument, refer to **When to Reverse Input Channels** section of [Converting a Model Using General Conversion Parameters](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_docs_MO_DG_prepare_model_convert_model_Converting_Model_General.html).

## Preparing to Run

For demo input image or video files you may refer to [Media Files Available for Demos](../../README.md#Media-Files-Available-for-Demos).
The list of models supported by the demo is in `<omz_dir>/demos/gesture_recognition_demo/python/models.lst` file.
This file can be used as a parameter for [Model Downloader](../../../tools/downloader/README.md) and Converter to download and, if necessary, convert models to OpenVINO Inference Engine format (\*.xml + \*.bin).

An example of using the Model Downloader:

```sh
python3 <omz_dir>/tools/downloader/downloader.py --list models.lst
```

An example of using the Model Converter:

```sh
python3 <omz_dir>/tools/downloader/converter.py --list models.lst
```

### Supported Models

* asl-recognition-0004
* common-sign-language-0001
* common-sign-language-0002
* person-detection-asl-0001

> **NOTE**: Refer to the tables [Intel's Pre-Trained Models Device Support](../../../models/intel/device_support.md) and [Public Pre-Trained Models Device Support](../../../models/public/device_support.md) for the details on models inference support at different devices.

Run the application with the `-h` option to see the following usage message:

```

                        recognition model.

                        Optional. Number of frames to store in output.
                        If 0 is set, all frames are stored.

                        is CPU).

```

Running the application with an empty list of options yields the short version of the usage message and an error message.

To run the demo, please provide paths to the gesture recognition and person detection models in the IR format, to a file with class names, and to an input video:

```bash
python gesture_recognition_demo.py \
    -m_a <path_to_model>/asl-recognition-0004.xml \
    -m_d <path_to_model>/person-detection-asl-0001.xml \
    -i 0 \
    -c <omz_dir>/data/dataset_classes/msasl100.json
```

The demo starts in person tracking mode and to switch it in the action recognition mode you should press `0-9` button with appropriate detection ID (the number in top-left of each bounding box). If frame contains only one person, they will be chosen automatically. After that you can switch back to tracking mode by pressing space button.

An example of file with class names can be found within the OMZ directory:

* MS-ASL-100: `<omz_dir>/data/dataset_classes/msasl100.json`
* Jester-27: `<omz_dir>/data/dataset_classes/jester27.json`
* Common-Sign-Language-12: `<omz_dir>/data/dataset_classes/common_sign_language12.json`

> **NOTE**: To run the demo application with video examples of gestures specify the `-s` key with valid path to the directory with video samples. The name of each video sample should be the valid name of gesture from `<omz_dir>/data/dataset_classes/msasl100.json` file. To navigate between samples use 'f' and 'b' keys for iterating next and previous video sample, respectively.

## Demo Output

The application uses OpenCV to display gesture recognition result and current inference performance.
