# Multi-Channel C++ Demos

The demos provide an inference pipeline for two multi-channel scenarios: face detection and human pose estimation. For more information, refer to the corresponding pages:
* [Multi-Channel Face Detection C++ Demo](./face_detection/README.md)
* [Multi-Channel Human Pose Estimation C++ Demo](./human_pose_estimation/README.md)
