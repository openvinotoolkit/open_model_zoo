# Colorization Demo

This demo demonstrates an example of using neural networks to colorize a video.
You can use the following models with the demo:

* `colorization-v2`
* `colorization-v2-norebal`

For more information about pretrained models, refer to the [model documentation](../../../models/public/index.md).

### How It Works

On the start-up, the application reads command-line parameters and loads one network to the Inference Engine for execution.

Once the program receives an image, it performs the following steps:
1. Converts the frame of video into the LAB color space.
2. Uses the L-channel to predict A and B channels.
3. Restores the image by converting it into the BGR color space.

### Running the Demo

Running the application with the `-h` option yields the following usage message:

```
usage: colorization_demo.py [-h] -m MODEL --coeffs COEFFS [-d DEVICE] -i
                            "<path>" [--no_show] [-v]
                            [-u UTILIZATION_MONITORS]

Options:
  -h, --help            Help with the script.
  -m MODEL, --model MODEL
                        Required. Path to .xml file with pre-trained model.
  --coeffs COEFFS       Required. Path to .npy file with color coefficients.
  -d DEVICE, --device DEVICE
                        Optional. Specify target device for infer: CPU, GPU,
                        FPGA, HDDL or MYRIAD. Default: CPU
  -i "<path>", --input "<path>"
                        Required. Input to process.
  --no_show             Optional. Disable display of results on screen.
  -v, --verbose         Optional. Enable display of processing logs on screen.
  -u UTILIZATION_MONITORS, --utilization_monitors UTILIZATION_MONITORS
                        Optional. List of monitors to show initially.
```

To run the demo, you can use public or pretrained models. To download pretrained models, use the OpenVINO&trade; [Model Downloader](../../../tools/downloader/README.md) or go to the [Intel&reg; Open Source Technology Center](https://download.01.org/opencv/).

> **NOTE**: Before running the demo with a trained model, make sure the model is converted to the Inference Engine format (\*.xml + \*.bin) using the [Model Optimizer tool](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_docs_MO_DG_Deep_Learning_Model_Optimizer_DevGuide.html).

### Demo Output

The demo uses OpenCV to display the colorized frame.
