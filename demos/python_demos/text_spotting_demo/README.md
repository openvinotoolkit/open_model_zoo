# Text Spotting Python* Demo

This demo shows how to run Text Spotting models. Text Spotting models allow us to simultaneously detect and recognize text.

> **NOTE**: Only batch size of 1 is supported.

## How It Works

The demo application expects a text spotting model that is split into three parts. Every model part must be in the Intermediate Representation (IR) format.

First model is Mask-RCNN like text detector with the following constraints:

* Two inputs: `im_data` for input image and `im_info` for meta-information about the image (actual height, width and scale).
* At least five outputs including:
    * `boxes` with absolute bounding box coordinates of the input image
    * `scores` with confidence scores for all bounding boxes
    * `classes` with object class IDs for all bounding boxes
    * `raw_masks` with fixed-size segmentation heat maps for all classes of all bounding boxes
    * `text_features` with text features which are fed to Text Recognition Head further

Second model is Text Recognition Encoder that takes `text_features` as input and produces `encoded text`.

Third model is Text Recognition Decoder that takes `encoded text` from Text Recognition Encoder ,`previous symbol` and `hidden state`. On the first step special `Start Of Sequence (SOS)` symbol and zero `hidden state` are fed to Text Recognition Decoder. The decoder produces `symbols distribution`, `current hidden state` each step until `End Of Sequence (EOS)` symbol is generated.

As input, the demo application takes a path to a single image file, a video file or a numeric ID of a web camera specified with a command-line argument `-i`.

The demo workflow is the following:

1. The demo application reads image/video frames one by one, resizes them to fit into the input image blob of the network (`im_data`).
2. The `im_info` input blob passes resulting resolution and scale of a pre-processed image to the network to perform inference of Mask-RCNN-like text detector.
3. The Text Recognition Encoder takes input from the text detector and produces output.
4. The Text Recognition Decoder takes output from the Text Recognition Encoder output as input and produces output.
5. The demo visualizes the resulting text spotting results. Certain command-line options affect the visualization:
    * If you specify `--show_boxes` and `--show_scores` arguments, bounding boxes and confidence scores are also shown.
    * By default, tracking is used to show text instance with the same color throughout the whole video.
      It assumes more or less static scene with instances in two frames being a part of the same track if intersection over union of the masks is greater than the 0.5 threshold. To disable tracking, specify the `--no_track` argument.

> **NOTE**: By default, Open Model Zoo demos expect input with BGR channels order. If you trained your model to work with RGB order, you need to manually rearrange the default channels order in the demo application or reconvert your model using the Model Optimizer tool with `--reverse_input_channels` argument specified. For more information about the argument, refer to **When to Reverse Input Channels** section of [Converting a Model Using General Conversion Parameters](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_docs_MO_DG_prepare_model_convert_model_Converting_Model_General.html).

Running the application with an empty list of options yields the short version of the usage message and an error message.

To run the demo, you can use public or pre-trained models. To download the pre-trained models, use the OpenVINO [Model Downloader](../../../tools/downloader/README.md) or go to [https://download.01.org/opencv/](https://download.01.org/opencv/).

> **NOTE**: Before running the demo with a trained model, make sure the model is converted to the Inference Engine format (`*.xml` + `*.bin`) using the [Model Optimizer tool](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_docs_MO_DG_Deep_Learning_Model_Optimizer_DevGuide.html).

To run the demo, please provide paths to the model in the IR format and to an input video, image, or folder with images:
```bash
python3 text_spotting_demo.py \
-m_m <path_to_models>/text-spotting-0002-detector.xml \
-m_te <path_to_models>/text-spotting-0002-recognizer-encoder.xml \
-m_td <path_to_models>/text-spotting-0002-recognizer-decoder.xml \
-i input_image.jpg
```

## Demo Output
