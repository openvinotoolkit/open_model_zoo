# Metrics

For correct work metrics require specific representation format. 
(e. g. map expects detection annotation and detection prediction for evaluation). 

In case when you use complicated representation located in representation container, you need to add options `annotation_source` and `prediction_source` in configuration file to
select specific representation, another way metric calculation possible only if container has only one suitable representation and will be resolved automatically.
`annotation_source` and `prediction_source` should contain only one annotation identifier and output layer name respectively.
You may optionally provide `reference` field for metric, if you want calculated metric tested against specific value (i.e. reported in canonical paper) and acceptable `threshold` for metric deviation from reference value.

Every metric has parameters available for configuration. 

Accuracy Checker supports following set of metrics:

* `accuracy` - classification accuracy metric, defined as the number of correct predictions divided by the total number of predictions.
Supported representation: `ClassificationAnnotation`, `ClassificationPrediction`
  * `top_k` - the number of classes with the highest probability, which will be used to decide if prediction is correct.
* `accuracy_per_class` - classification accuracy metric which represents results for each class. Supported representation: `ClassificationAnnotation`, `ClassificationPrediction`.
  * `top_k` - the number of classes with the highest probability, which will be used to decide if prediction is correct.
