# G-API Interactive Face Detection Demo

This demo showcases Object Detection task applied for face recognition using sequence of neural networks.
The pipeline is based on [G-API framework](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d0/d1e/gapi.html). This demo executes six [kernels](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d0/d25/gapi_kernel_api.html), five of them infer networks and another one is a postprocessing kernel.
This demo executes the Face Detection, Age/Gender Recognition, Head Pose Estimation, Emotions Recognition, and Facial Landmarks Detection networks. You can use a set of the following pre-trained models with the demo:

* `face-detection-adas-0001`, which is a primary detection network for finding faces
* `age-gender-recognition-retail-0013`, which is executed on top of the results of the first model and reports estimated age and gender for each detected face
* `head-pose-estimation-adas-0001`, which is executed on top of the results of the first model and reports estimated head pose in Tait-Bryan angles
* `emotions-recognition-retail-0003`, which is executed on top of the results of the first model and reports an emotion for each detected face
* `facial-landmarks-35-adas-0002`, which is executed on top of the results of the first model and reports normed coordinates of estimated facial landmarks

Other demo objectives are:

* Visualization of the resulting face bounding boxes from Face Detection network
* Visualization of age/gender, head pose, emotion information, and facial landmarks positions for each detected face

OpenCV is used to draw resulting bounding boxes, labels, and other information. You can copy and paste this code without pulling Inference Engine demo helpers into your application.

## How It Works

1. The application reads command-line parameters and loads up to five networks depending on `-m...` options family to the Inference
Engine.
2. G-API pipeline gets a video/image/camera like a source, using the OpenCV VideoCapture.
3. G-API pipeline performs inference on the Face Detection network.
4. G-API pipeline runs post processing kernel.
5. G-API pipeline performs four inferences, using the Age/Gender, Head Pose, Emotions, and Facial Landmarks detection networks if they are specified in the command line.
6. The application displays the results.

> **NOTE**: By default, Open Model Zoo demos expect input with BGR channels order. If you trained your model to work with RGB order, you need to manually rearrange the default channels order in the demo application or reconvert your model using the Model Optimizer tool with `--reverse_input_channels` argument specified. For more information about the argument, refer to **When to Reverse Input Channels** section of [Converting a Model Using General Conversion Parameters](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_docs_MO_DG_prepare_model_convert_model_Converting_Model_General.html).

## Preparing to Run

For demo input image or video files you may refer to [Media Files Available for Demos](../../README.md#Media-Files-Available-for-Demos).
The list of models supported by the demo is in `<omz_dir>/demos/interactive_face_detection_demo/cpp_gapi/models.lst` file.
This file can be used as a parameter for [Model Downloader](../../../tools/downloader/README.md) and Converter to download and, if necessary, convert models to OpenVINO Inference Engine format (\*.xml + \*.bin).

An example of using the Model Downloader:

```sh
python3 <omz_dir>/tools/downloader/downloader.py --list models.lst
```

An example of using the Model Converter:

```sh
python3 <omz_dir>/tools/downloader/converter.py --list models.lst
```
