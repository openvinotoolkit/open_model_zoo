# Formula Recognition Python\* Demo

![example](./demo_intro.gif)

This demo shows how to run LaTeX formula recognition models. These models allow to get a LaTeX formula markup from the image.

> **NOTE**: Only batch size of 1 is supported.

## How It Works

The demo application expects a formula recognition model that is split into two parts. Every model part must be in the Intermediate Representation (IR) format.

The First model is Encoder which extracts features from an image and prepares first steps of the decoder.

* One input is `imgs` for input image
* Four outputs are:
    * Row encoding out (`row_enc_out`) extracts features from the image
    * `hidden` and
    * `context` are intermediate states of the LSTM
    * `init_0` - first state of the encoder

Second model is Decoder that takes as input:

* `row_enc_out` - extracted images features from the encoder
* Decoding state context (`dec_st_c`) and
* Decoding state hidden (`dec_st_h`) - current states of the LSTM
* `output_prev` - previous output of the Decode Step (for the first time it is `init_0` of the encoder)
* Target (`tgt`) - previous token (for the first time it is `START_TOKEN` )
Second model is being executed until current decoded token is `END_TOKEN` or length of the formula is less then `--max_formula_len` producing one token per each decode step.

The demo application takes an input with the help of the `-i` argument. This could be:

* Path to a single image
* Path to a folder with images
> In this Case non-interactive mode would be triggered. This means that demo will run the model over the input image(s) and will try to predict the formula. The output would be stored in the console or in the output file (if specified)
* Integer identifier of the device (e.g. webcam), typically 0.
* Path to a video (.avi, .mp4, etc)
> This will trigger interactive mode, which would be explained in detail later.

Vocabulary files are provided under corresponding model configuration directory.

### Non-interactive mode

Non-interactive mode assumes that demo processes inputs sequentially.
The demo workflow in non-interactive mode is the following:

1. The demo application reads a single image or iterates over all images in the given folder, then crops or resizes and inputs to fit into the input image blob of the network (`imgs`). Crop and pad is used to keep size of the font.
2. For each image, encoder extracts features from the image
3. While length of the current formula is less then `--max_formula_len` or current token is not `END_TOKEN` Decode Step produces new tokens.
4. The demo prints the decoded text to a file if `-o` parameter specified or into the console and (optionally) renders predicted formula into image.

#### Rendering of the LaTeX formula into image

User has an option to render the LaTeX formula predicted by the demo application into an image.
Regardless of what mode is selected (interactive or non-interactive) the process of the rendering of the formula is the same.

##### Requirements for rendering

Sympy python package is used for rendering. To install it, please, run:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
Sympy package needs LaTeX system installed in the operating system.
For Windows you can use MiKTeX (just download and install it), for Ubuntu/MacOS you can use TeX Live:
Ubuntu:
`apt-get update && apt-get install texlive`
MacOS:
`brew install texlive`
> Note: Other LaTeX systems should also work.

### Interactive mode

The example of the interface:
![interactive example](./interactive_interface.png)
When User runs demo application with the `-i` option and passes video or number of the webcam device as an argument (typically 0), window with the image simillar to above should pop up.

Example of usage of the interactive mode:

```sh
python formula_recognition_demo.py <required args> -i 0
```

or

```sh
python formula_recognition_demo.py <required args> -i input_video.mp4
```

The window has four main sections:

1. A red rectangle is placed on the center of this window. This is input "target", with the help of which User, moving the camera, can capture formula.
2. Image from the input target will be binarized, preprocessed and fed to the network. Preprocessed and binarized image is placed on the top of the window (near `Model input` label)
3. If the formula will be predicted with sufficient confidence score, it will be placed right under preprocessed image (near `Predicted` label)
4. If rendering is available (see the previous Paragraph for details) and predicted formula does not contain LaTeX grammar errors, it will be rendered and placed near `Rendered` label.

Navigation keys:

* Use `q` button to quit the program
* Use `o` to decrease the size of the input (red) window
* Use `p` to increase the size of the input window

The overall process is simillar to the Non-interactive mode with the exception that it runs asynchronously.
This means model inference and rendering of the formula do not block main thread, so the image from the web camera can move smoothly.

> **NOTE**: By default, Open Model Zoo demos expect input with BGR channels order. If you trained your model to work with RGB order, you need to manually rearrange the default channels order in the demo application or reconvert your model using the Model Optimizer tool with `--reverse_input_channels` argument specified. For more information about the argument, refer to **When to Reverse Input Channels** section of [Converting a Model Using General Conversion Parameters](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_docs_MO_DG_prepare_model_convert_model_Converting_Model_General.html).

The demo has two preprocessing types: Crop and Pad to target shape and Resize and pad to target shape. Two preprocessing types are used for two different datasets as model trained with concrete font size, so if one wants to run the model on inputs with bigger font size (e.g. if input is photographed in 12Mpx, while model trained to imitate scans in ~3Mpx) they should first resize the input to make font size like in train set. Example of the target font size:
