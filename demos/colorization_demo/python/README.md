# Colorization Demo

This demo demonstrates an example of using neural networks to colorize a grayscale image or video.

## How It Works

On startup, the application reads command-line parameters and loads one network to the Inference Engine for execution. Once the program receives an image, it performs the following steps:

1. Converts the frame into the LAB color space.
2. Uses the L-channel to predict A and B channels.
3. Restores the image by converting it into the BGR color space.

## Preparing to Run

For demo input image or video files you may refer to [Media Files Available for Demos](../../README.md#Media-Files-Available-for-Demos).
The list of models supported by the demo is in `<omz_dir>/demos/colorization_demo/python/models.lst` file.
This file can be used as a parameter for [Model Downloader](../../../tools/downloader/README.md) and Converter to download and, if necessary, convert models to OpenVINO Inference Engine format (\*.xml + \*.bin).

An example of using the Model Downloader:

```sh
python3 <omz_dir>/tools/downloader/downloader.py --list models.lst
```

An example of using the Model Converter:

```sh
python3 <omz_dir>/tools/downloader/converter.py --list models.lst
```

### Supported Models

* colorization-v2
* colorization-siggraph

> **NOTE**: Refer to the tables [Intel's Pre-Trained Models Device Support](../../../models/intel/device_support.md) and [Public Pre-Trained Models Device Support](../../../models/public/device_support.md) for the details on models inference support at different devices.

## Running the Demo

Running the application with the `-h` option yields the following usage message:

```
usage: colorization_demo.py [-h] -m MODEL [-d DEVICE] -i INPUT [--loop]
                            [-o OUTPUT] [-limit OUTPUT_LIMIT]
                            [--no_show] [-v] [-u UTILIZATION_MONITORS]

Options:
  -h, --help            Help with the script.
  -m MODEL, --model MODEL
                        Required. Path to .xml file with pre-trained model.
  -d DEVICE, --device DEVICE
                        Optional. Specify target device for infer: CPU, GPU,
                        HDDL or MYRIAD. Default: CPU
  -i INPUT, --input INPUT
                        Required. An input to process. The input must be a single image,
                        a folder of images, video file or camera id.
  --loop                Optional. Enable reading the input in a loop.
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Optional. Name of the output file(s) to save.
  -limit OUTPUT_LIMIT, --output_limit OUTPUT_LIMIT
                        Optional. Number of frames to store in output.
                        If 0 is set, all frames are stored.
  --no_show             Optional. Don't show output.
  -u UTILIZATION_MONITORS, --utilization_monitors UTILIZATION_MONITORS
                        Optional. List of monitors to show initially.
```
Running the application with an empty list of options yields the short version of the usage message and an error message.

To run the demo, please provide paths to the model in the IR format, and to an input video or image(s):

```bash
python colorization_demo.py \
    -i <path_to_image>/<image_name>.jpg \
    -m <path_to_model>/colorization-v2.xml
```

>**NOTE**: If you provide a single image as an input, the demo processes and renders it quickly, then exits. To continuously visualize inference results on the screen, apply the `loop` option, which enforces processing a single image in a loop.

You can save processed results to a Motion JPEG AVI file or separate JPEG or PNG files using the `-o` option:

* To save processed results in an AVI file, specify the name of the output file with `avi` extension, for example: `-o output.avi`.
* To save processed results as images, specify the template name of the output image file with `jpg` or `png` extension, for example: `-o output_%03d.jpg`. The actual file names are constructed from the template at runtime by replacing regular expression `%03d` with the frame number, resulting in the following: `output_000.jpg`, `output_001.jpg`, and so on.
To avoid disk space overrun in case of continuous input stream, like camera, you can limit the amount of data stored in the output file(s) with the `limit` option. The default value is 1000. To change it, you can apply the `-limit N` option, where `N` is the number of frames to store.

>**NOTE**: Windows\* systems may not have the Motion JPEG codec installed by default. If this is the case, you can download OpenCV FFMPEG back end using the PowerShell script provided with the OpenVINO &trade; install package and located at `<INSTALL_DIR>/opencv/ffmpeg-download.ps1`. The script should be run with administrative privileges if OpenVINO &trade; is installed in a system protected folder (this is a typical case). Alternatively, you can save results as images.

## Demo Output

The demo uses OpenCV to display the colorized frame.
