# Smart Classroom C++ Demo

![example](./smart_classroom.gif)

The demo shows an example of joint usage of several neural networks to detect student actions (sitting, standing, raising hand for the `person-detection-action-recognition-0005` model and sitting, writing, raising hand, standing, turned around, lie on the desk for the `person-detection-action-recognition-0006` model) and recognize people by faces in the classroom environment. The demo uses Async API for action and face detection networks. It allows to parallelize execution of face recognition and detection: while face recognition is running on one accelerator, face and action detection could be performed on another. You can use a set of the following pre-trained models with the demo:

* `face-detection-adas-0001`, which is a primary detection network for finding faces.
* `landmarks-regression-retail-0009`, which is executed on top of the results from the first network and outputs
a vector of facial landmarks for each detected face.
* `face-reidentification-retail-0095`,  which is executed on top of the results from the first network and outputs
a vector of features for each detected face.
* `person-detection-action-recognition-0005`, which is a detection network for finding persons and simultaneously predicting their current actions (3 actions - sitting, standing, raising hand).
* `person-detection-action-recognition-0006`, which is a detection network for finding persons and simultaneously predicting their current actions (6 actions: sitting, writing, raising hand, standing, turned around, lie on the desk).
* `person-detection-raisinghand-recognition-0001`, which is a detection network for finding students and simultaneously predicting their current actions (in contrast with the previous model, predicts only if a student raising hand or not).
* `person-detection-action-recognition-teacher-0002`, which is a detection network for finding persons and simultaneously predicting their current actions.

## How It Works

On startup, the application reads command line parameters and loads four networks to the Inference Engine for execution on different devices depending on `-m...` options family. Upon getting a frame from the OpenCV VideoCapture, it performs inference of Face Detection and Action Detection networks. After that, the ROIs obtained by Face Detector are fed to the Facial Landmarks Regression network. Then landmarks are used to align faces by affine transform and feed them to the Face Recognition network. The recognized faces are matched with detected actions to find an action for a recognized person for each frame.

> **NOTE**: By default, Open Model Zoo demos expect input with BGR channels order. If you trained your model to work with RGB order, you need to manually rearrange the default channels order in the demo application or reconvert your model using the Model Optimizer tool with the `--reverse_input_channels` argument specified. For more information about the argument, refer to **When to Reverse Input Channels** section of [Converting a Model Using General Conversion Parameters](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_docs_MO_DG_prepare_model_convert_model_Converting_Model_General.html).

## Creating a Gallery for Face Recognition

To recognize faces on a frame, the demo needs a gallery of reference images. Each image should contain a tight crop of face. You can create the gallery from an arbitrary list of images:

1. Put images containing tight crops of frontal-oriented faces (or use `-crop_gallery` key for the demo) to a separate empty folder. Each identity must have only one image. Name images as `id_name0.png, id_name1.png, ...`.
2. Run the `create_list.py <path_to_folder_with_images>` command to get a list of files and identities in `.json` format.

## Preparing to Run

For demo input image or video files you may refer to [Media Files Available for Demos](../../README.md#Media-Files-Available-for-Demos).
The list of models supported by the demo is in `<omz_dir>/demos/smart_classroom_demo/cpp/models.lst` file.
This file can be used as a parameter for [Model Downloader](../../../tools/downloader/README.md) and Converter to download and, if necessary, convert models to OpenVINO Inference Engine format (\*.xml + \*.bin).

An example of using the Model Downloader:

```sh
python3 <omz_dir>/tools/downloader/downloader.py --list models.lst
```

An example of using the Model Converter:
