# BERT Question Answering Python\* Demo

This README describes the Question Answering demo application that uses a Squad-tuned BERT model for inference.

## How It Works

On startup the demo application reads command line parameters and loads a model to OpenVINOâ„¢ Runtime plugin.
It also fetches data from the user-provided url to populate the "context" text.
The text is then used to search answers for user-provided questions.

## Model API

The demo utilizes model wrappers, adapters and pipelines from [Python* Model API](../../common/python/openvino/model_zoo/model_api/README.md).

The generalized interface of wrappers with its unified results representation provides the support of multiple different question answering model topologies in one demo.

## Preparing to Run

The list of models supported by the demo is in `<omz_dir>/demos/bert_question_answering_demo/python/models.lst` file.
This file can be used as a parameter for [Model Downloader](../../../tools/model_tools/README.md) and Converter to download and, if necessary, convert models to OpenVINO IR format (\*.xml + \*.bin).

An example of using the Model Downloader:

```sh
omz_downloader --list models.lst
```

An example of using the Model Converter:

```sh
omz_converter --list models.lst
```

### Supported Models

* bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-squad-0001
* bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-squad-int8-0001
* bert-small-uncased-whole-word-masking-squad-0001
* bert-small-uncased-whole-word-masking-squad-0002
* bert-small-uncased-whole-word-masking-squad-int8-0002

The "small" variants of these are so-called "distilled" models, which originated from the BERT Large but substantially smaller and faster.
If you want to use an official MLPerf* BERT ONNX model rather than the distilled model on the Open model Zoo, the command line to convert the [int8 model](https://zenodo.org/record/3750364) is as follows:

```sh
    python3 mo.py
            -m <path_to_model>/bert_large_v1_1_fake_quant.onnx
            --input "input_ids,attention_mask,token_type_ids"
            --input_shape "[1,384],[1,384],[1,384]"
            --keep_shape_ops
```

> **NOTE**: Refer to the tables [Intel's Pre-Trained Models Device Support](../../../models/intel/device_support.md) and [Public Pre-Trained Models Device Support](../../../models/public/device_support.md) for the details on models inference support at different devices.

## Running

Running the application with the `-h` option yields the following usage message:

## Example Demo Cmd-Line

```sh
    python3 bert_question_answering_demo.py
            --vocab=<models_dir>/models/intel/bert-small-uncased-whole-word-masking-squad-0001/vocab.txt
            --model=<path_to_model>/bert-small-uncased-whole-word-masking-squad-0001.xml
            --input_names="input_ids,attention_mask,token_type_ids"
            --output_names="output_s,output_e"
            --input="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bert_(Sesame_Street)"
            -c
```

The demo will use a wiki-page about the Bert character to answer your questions like "who is Bert", "how old is Bert", etc.

## Running with OpenVINO Model Server

You can also run this demo with model served in [OpenVINO Model Server](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/model_server). Refer to [`OVMSAdapter`](../../common/python/openvino/model_zoo/model_api/adapters/ovms_adapter.md) to learn about running demos with OVMS.

Exemplary command:

```sh
    python3 bert_question_answering_demo.py
            --vocab=<models_dir>/models/intel/bert-small-uncased-whole-word-masking-squad-0001/vocab.txt
            --model=localhost:9000/models/bert
            --input_names="input_ids,attention_mask,token_type_ids"
            --output_names="output_s,output_e"
            --input="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bert_(Sesame_Street)"
            --adapter ovms
            -c
```

## Demo Inputs

The application reads text from the HTML page at the given url and then answers questions typed from the console.
The model and its parameters (inputs and outputs) are also important demo arguments.
Notice that since order of inputs for the model does matter, the demo script checks that the inputs specified
from the command-line match the actual network inputs.
When the reshape option (`-r`)  is specified, the script also attempts to reshape the network to the
length of the context plus length of the question (both in tokens), if the resulting value is smaller than the original
sequence length that the network expects. This is performance (speed) and memory footprint saving option.
Since some networks are not-reshapable (due to limitations of the internal layers) the reshaping might fail,
so you will need to run the demo without it.
Please see general [reshape intro and limitations](https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/_docs_IE_DG_ShapeInference.html)

## Demo Outputs

The application outputs found answers to the same console.
The application reports

* **Latency**: total processing time required to process input data (from loading the vocab and processing the context as tokens to displaying the results).

## Classifying Documents with Long Texts

Notice that when the original "context" (text from the url) together with the question do not fit the model input
(usually 384 tokens for the Bert-Large, or 128 for the Bert-Base), the demo splits the context into overlapping segments.
Thus, for the long texts, the network is called multiple times. The results are then sorted by the probabilities.
