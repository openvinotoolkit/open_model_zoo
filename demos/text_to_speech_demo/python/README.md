# Text-to-speech Python\* Demo

The text to speech demo shows how to run the ForwardTacotron and WaveRNN models or modified ForwardTacotron and MelGAN models to produce an audio file for a given input text file.
The demo is based on https://github.com/seungwonpark/melgan, https://github.com/as-ideas/ForwardTacotron and https://github.com/fatchord/WaveRNN repositories.

## How It Works

On startup, the demo application reads command-line parameters and loads four or three models to OpenVINOâ„¢ Runtime plugin. The demo pipeline reads text file by lines and divides every line to parts by punctuation marks.
The heuristic algorithm chooses punctuation near to the some threshold by sentence length.
When inference is done, the application outputs the audio to the WAV file with 22050 Hz sample rate.

## Preparing to Run

The list of models supported by the demo is in `<omz_dir>/demos/text_to_speech_demo/python/models.lst` file.
This file can be used as a parameter for [Model Downloader](../../../tools/model_tools/README.md) and Converter to download and, if necessary, convert models to OpenVINO IR format (\*.xml + \*.bin).

An example of using the Model Downloader:

```sh
omz_downloader --list models.lst
```

An example of using the Model Converter:

```sh
omz_converter --list models.lst
```

## Running

Running the application with the `-h` option yields the following usage message:

```

                        Optional. Specify the target device to infer on; CPU,
                        GPU, HDDL, MYRIAD or HETERO is acceptable. The
                        demo will look for a suitable plugin for device

## Example for Running with Arguments

### Speech synthesis with ForwardTacotron and WaveRNN models

```sh
python3 text_to_speech_demo.py \
    --input <path_to_file>/text.txt \
    -o <path_to_audio>/audio.wav \
    --model_duration <path_to_model>/forward_tacotron_duration_prediction.xml \
    --model_forward <path_to_model>/forward_tacotron_regression.xml \
    --model_upsample <path_to_model>/wavernn_upsampler.xml \
    --model_rnn <path_to_model>/wavernn_rnn.xml
```

> **NOTE**: You can use `--upsampler_width` parameter for this demo for the purpose of control width of the time axis
> in the input mel-spectrogram for the `wavernn_upsampler` network. This option can help you improve the speed of
> the pipeline inference on the long sentences.

### Speech synthesis with text-to-speech-en-0001 models

```sh
python3 text_to_speech_demo.py \
    -i <path_to_file>/text.txt \
    -o <path_to_audio>/audio.wav \
    -m_duration <path_to_model>/text-to-speech-en-0001-duration-prediction.xml \
    -m_forward <path_to_model>/text-to-speech-en-0001-regression.xml \
    -m_melgan <path_to_model>/text-to-speech-en-0001-generation.xml
```

### Speech synthesis with multi-speaker text-to-speech-en-multi-0001 models

```sh
python3 text_to_speech_demo.py \
    -i <path_to_file>/text.txt \
    -o <path_to_audio>/audio.wav \
    -s_id 19 \
    -m_duration <path_to_model>/text-to-speech-en-multi-0001-duration-prediction.xml \
    -m_forward <path_to_model>/text-to-speech-en-multi-0001-regression.xml \
    -m_melgan <path_to_model>/text-to-speech-en-multi-0001-generation.xml
```

> **NOTE**: `s_id` defines the style of the speaker utterance. You can choose it equal to -1 to activate the
> multi-speaker TTS model parameters selection window. This window provides an opportunity to choose the gender of the
> speaker, index number of the speaker or calculate PCA based speaker embedding. The `s_id` is available only for
> `text-to-speech-en-multi-0001` models.
