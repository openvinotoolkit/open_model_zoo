# [OpenVINO™ Toolkit](https://docs.openvino.ai/2023.0/index.html) - Open Model Zoo repository

> [!NOTE]
> Open Model Zoo is in maintenance mode as a source of models. Check out model tutorials in [Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino_notebooks).

This repository includes optimized deep learning models and a set of demos to expedite development of high-performance deep learning inference applications. Use these free pre-trained models instead of training your own models to speed-up the development and production deployment process.
